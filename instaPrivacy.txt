I. INTRODUCTION
1. With this Second Report and Order (Order), we bring to a close the 2010 and 2014 
Quadrennial Review proceedings.1 In this Order, we maintain strong media ownership rules, take steps to 
help promote small business participation in the broadcast industry, and adopt rules that will help to 
promote transparency in local television markets.  The Commission has built a substantial record that 
evidences both the existence of a dynamic media marketplace and the continuing importance of 
traditional media outlets in their local communities.  We recognize that broadband Internet and other 
technological advances have changed the ways in which many consumers access entertainment, news, 
and information programming.  Traditional media outlets, however, are still of vital importance to their 
local communities and essential to achieving the Commission�s goals of competition, localism, and 
viewpoint diversity.  This is particularly true with respect to local news and public interest programming, 
with traditional media outlets continuing to serve as the primary sources on which consumers rely.  
2. Moreover, for television broadcasters, theirs is an industry on the precipice of great 
change.  The ongoing voluntary incentive auction of broadcast television spectrum, which is critically 
important to the Commission�s efforts to unleash the full transformative potential of broadband Internet, 
provides television broadcasters with a new and unique financial opportunity.  We anticipate that the 
auction will both free up significant spectrum for mobile broadband and result in an even healthier 
broadcast industry.  While the auction may have a dramatic impact on the television landscape in many 
local markets, based on our assessment of the record and the ongoing nature of the auction, we find that it 
is too soon to quantify this impact; accordingly, it would be premature to change our media ownership 
rules in anticipation of the incentive auction�s impact at this time.2 We will soon commence our 
evaluation of the broadcast marketplace post-auction, and we expect that these issues will feature 
prominently in future media ownership reviews.     
3. Based on our careful review of the record, we find that the public interest is best served 
by retaining our existing rules, with some minor modifications.  These rules promote competition and a 
diversity of viewpoints in local markets, thereby enriching local communities through the promotion of 
distinct and antagonistic voices.  Ideally, our media landscape should be diverse because our population is 
diverse, and retaining the existing media ownership rules is one way in which the Commission can help to 
promote such diversity.  The record in this proceeding leads us to conclude that retaining the existing 
rules is the best way to promote our policy goals in local markets at this time.  In addition, following the 
Third Circuit�s decision in Prometheus III, we are readopting the Television Joint Sales Agreement (JSA) 
Attribution Rule adopted in the Report and Order in this proceeding.3

4. We also address in this Order the Third Circuit�s remand in Prometheus II of certain 
aspects of the Commission�s 2008 Diversity Order.4 Specifically, we reinstate the revenue-based eligible 
entity standard, as well as the associated measures to promote the Commission�s goal of encouraging 
small business participation in the broadcast industry, which we believe will cultivate innovation and 
enhance viewpoint diversity.  Also, as directed by the court, we have considered the socially and 
economically disadvantaged business definition as a possible basis for favorable regulatory treatment, as 
well as other possible definitions that would expressly recognize the race and ethnicity of applicants.5  
However, we find that the demanding legal standards the courts have said must be met before the 
Government may implement preferences based on such race- or gender-conscious definitions have not 
been satisfied.  
5. Finally, we take steps to address concerns about the use of a variety of sharing 
agreements between independently owned commercial television stations.  Specifically, we adopt a 
definition of Shared Service Agreements (SSAs) and require commercial television stations to disclose 
those SSAs by placing the agreements in each station�s online public inspection file.  This action will lead 
to more comprehensive information about the prevalence and content of SSAs between television 
stations, which will improve the Commission�s and the public�s ability to assess the potential impact of 
these agreements on the Commission�s rules and policies.  
II. BACKGROUND
6. The media ownership rules subject to this Quadrennial Review are the Local Television 
Ownership Rule, the Local Radio Ownership Rule, the Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule, the 
Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule, and the Dual Network Rule.6 Congress requires the 
Commission to review these rules every four years to determine whether they �are necessary in the public 
interest as the result of competition� and to �repeal or modify any regulation [the Commission] 
determines to be no longer in the public interest.�7 The Third Circuit has instructed that �necessary in the 
public interest� is a ��plain public interest� standard under which �necessary� means �convenient,� 
�useful,� or �helpful,� not �essential� or �indispensable.��8 There is no �presumption in favor of repealing 
or modifying the ownership rules.�9 Rather, the Commission has the discretion �to make [the rules] more

or less stringent.�10 This review focuses on determining whether there is a reasoned basis for retaining, 
repealing, or modifying each rule consistent with the public interest.11  
7. The Commission began the 2010 proceeding with a series of workshops held between 
November 2009 and May 2010.  Participants in the workshops discussed the scope and content of the 
review process.  Thereafter the Commission released a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) on May 25, 2010, seeking 
comment on a wide range of issues to help determine whether the current media ownership rules continue 
to serve the Commission�s policy goals.12 Subsequently, the Commission commissioned 11 economic 
studies, conducted by outside researchers and Commission staff, which were peer reviewed and then 
released to the public for comment, in order to provide data on the impact of market structure on the 
Commission�s policy goals of competition, localism, and diversity.13
8. After the release of the NOI, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued its opinion 
in Prometheus II, which considered appeals from the Commission�s review of the media ownership rules 
in the 2006 Quadrennial Review Order.14 The court affirmed the Commission�s decision to retain the 
Local Television and Radio Rules in order to protect competition in local media markets.15 The court also
affirmed the Commission�s retention of the Dual Network Rule based on potential harm to competition 
that would result from mergers among the top four networks.16 In addition, the court affirmed the 
Commission�s conclusion to retain the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule based on its contribution 
to the Commission�s diversity goal.17 The Third Circuit vacated and remanded the Newspaper/Broadcast 
Cross-Ownership Rule as modified by the Commission in the 2006 Quadrennial Review Order on 
procedural grounds, concluding that the Commission had failed to comply with the notice and comment 
provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).18 Finally, the court vacated and remanded a

number of measures adopted in the Commission�s 2008 Diversity Order.19 Specifically, the court vacated 
and remanded measures adopted in the Diversity Order that were designed to increase ownership 
opportunities for �eligible entities,� including minority- and women-owned entities, because it determined 
that the Commission�s revenue-based eligible entity definition was arbitrary and capricious.20 The court 
directed the Commission to address this issue in the course of the 2010 Quadrennial Review.
9. On December 22, 2011, the Commission released the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRM), in which the Commission proposed modest, incremental changes to the broadcast ownership 
rules and sought comment on those changes.  The Commission also sought comment in the NPRM on the 
aspects of the Commission�s 2008 Diversity Order that the Third Circuit had remanded in Prometheus II, 
as well as other actions that the Commission might take to increase the level of broadcast station 
ownership by minorities and women.  Finally, the Commission sought comment on various attribution 
issues that define which interests in a licensee must be counted in applying the broadcast ownership rules.  
In particular, the Commission sought comment on the impact of certain programming or other sharing 
agreements between stations and whether it should modify the broadcast attribution rules to account for 
such agreements or adopt disclosure requirements.  In doing so, the Commission referenced its pending 
proceeding regarding the potential attribution of television JSAs.21 In that proceeding, the Commission 
had tentatively concluded that television JSAs have the same effects in local television markets that radio 
JSAs do in local radio markets and that the Commission should therefore attribute television JSAs.  
10. On November 14, 2012, the Media Bureau released a report on the ownership of 
commercial broadcast stations (2012 323 Report).22 Consistent with other data and extensive comment 
already in the record, the 2012 323 Report confirmed low levels of broadcast station ownership by 
women and minorities�a situation long recognized by the Commission.23 On December 3, 2012, the 
Commission granted the request of several parties for �an additional, formal opportunity to comment on 
the [2012 323 Report].�24  On May 30, 2013, the Multicultural Media, Telecom and Internet Council

Broadcast Stations� (MMTC Cross-Ownership Study).25 The Commission sought comment on this study 
during the summer of 2013.26  
11. On April 15, 2014, the Commission released the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(FNPRM) (adopted March 31, 2014), which, building upon the record collected in the 2010 Quadrennial 
Review proceeding, initiated the 2014 Quadrennial Review proceeding.27 The FNPRM incorporated the 
existing 2010 record into the 2014 proceeding; proposed rules that were formulated based on evaluation 
of that existing record; and sought new and additional information and data on market conditions and 
competitive indicators.  As part of the same item, the Commission released the Report and Order, which 
adopted attribution rules for certain television JSAs.28  
12. In May 2014, multiple parties (Petitioners) sought appellate review of the FNPRM and 
Report and Order in both the D.C. Circuit and the Third Circuit.29 Petitioners challenged the JSA 
Attribution Rule and the agency�s decision to defer resolution of certain issues concerning its media 
ownership rules until it updates the record in this proceeding.  In addition, Prometheus Radio Project 
asserted that the Commission failed to comply with the Third Circuit�s order to justify or modify the 
Commission�s method of boosting minority ownership or to propose new measures to do so.  The D.C. 
Circuit was originally selected to hear the cases, but transferred the consolidated proceeding to the Third 
Circuit.  Oral arguments in the Third Circuit were held on April 19, 2016.   
13. On June 27, 2014, the Media Bureau released a further report on the ownership of 
commercial broadcast stations (2014 323 Report).30 Consistent with the 2012 323 Report and other data 
and extensive comment in the record, the 2014 323 Report confirmed low�and generally stable�levels 
of broadcast station ownership by women and minorities.  Also on June 27, 2014, the Media Bureau 
released an Order in this proceeding extending the comment and reply deadlines on the FNPRM, which 
also provided interested parties with an opportunity to provide comment on �any facts, information, or 
positions that are implicated by the content of the 2014 323 Report.�31

Analysis released and sought public comment on the Hispanic Television Study (as well as the associated

peer review report), a Commission study designed to examine the nexus between ownership, 
programming, and viewing, in order to expand the discussion and understanding of these 
interrelationships, particularly among Hispanic television station owners and Hispanic audiences.32  
Initially, comments were due on May 26, 2016, and replies on June 3, 2016; however, the Commission 
subsequently extended the deadlines to June 2, 2016, and June 9, 2016, respectively.33
15. On May 25, 2016, the Third Circuit issued a decision (Prometheus III) addressing the 
various challenges to the FNPRM and Report and Order. The court remanded the eligible entity issues to 
the Commission and ordered the Commission and certain public interest petitioners to engage in 
mediation to set a timetable for reaching final agency action on the eligible entity definition.  The court 
also vacated the Television JSA Attribution Rule�adopted in the Report and Order�finding that the 
Rule was adopted prematurely because the Commission had not yet determined whether the Local 
Television Ownership Rule remains necessary pursuant to Section 202(h).  The court stated that the Rule 
could be readopted if the Commission were to conclude, following completion of its Section 202(h) 
review, that the existing Local Television Ownership Rule should be retained or replaced with a new 
rule.34
16. Policy Goals. We continue to find that the longstanding policy goals of competition, 
localism, and diversity represent the appropriate framework within which to evaluate our media 
ownership rules.  Accordingly, we reject suggestions in the record that the Commission should adopt any 
additional or different policy goals.35 While those proposals generally represent worthwhile pursuits, we 
do not believe that they can be meaningfully promoted through the structural ownership rules and/or are 
outside the Commission�s statutory authority.
III. MEDIA OWNERSHIP RULES
A. Local Television Ownership Rule
1. Introduction
17. The current Local Television Ownership Rule allows an entity to own two television 
stations in the same Nielsen Designated Market Area (DMA) only if there is no Grade B contour overlap 
between the commonly owned stations, or at least one of the commonly owned stations is not ranked 
among the top-four stations in the market (top-four prohibition) and at least eight independently owned 
television stations remain in the DMA after ownership of the two stations is combined (eight-voices test).  
Based on the record that was compiled for the 2010 and 2014 Quadrennial Review proceedings, we find

Rules and Diversity of Ownership of Broadcast Stations, Public Notice, DA 16-534 (OSP/MB May 12, 2016).  Prior 
to peer review, the study was posted on the Commission�s website.  Press Release, FCC, FCC Posts Hispanic

26, 2016).
34 See generally Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC, 824 F.3d 33 (3d Cir. 2016) (Prometheus III).  The court also 
rejected the argument that the Commission acted �arbitrarily and capriciously by not attributing all . . . SSAs� in the 
Report and Order, crediting the Commission�s argument that it needed to study SSAs more closely before making 
an attribution decision.  Id. at 60 n.18.  
35 See, e.g., Diversity and Competition Supporters NPRM Comments at 5 (DCS) (proposing that the Commission 
adopt the goals of remedying the present effects of past discrimination and preventing future discrimination); Don 
Schellhardt NPRM Comments at 6 (urging the Commission to [promote/add] �robust employment� as a policy 
goal); Writers Guild of America, East, AFL-CIO NPRM Comments at 2-3(WGAE) (asserting that the Commission 
must add the goal of increasing the resources devoted to diverse local news programming in order to effectively 
promote the core policy goals of competition, localism, and diversity).  We note that remedying past discrimination 
is discussed in Section IV.C.2.b., infra.  
Federal Communications Commission FCC 16-107

that the current Local Television Ownership Rule, with a limited contour modification, remains necessary 
in the public interest.36 As discussed below, we find that the Local Television Ownership Rule remains 
necessary to promote competition and that this competition-based rule will continue to promote viewpoint 
diversity by helping to ensure the presence of independently owned broadcast television stations in local 
markets and is consistent with our localism goal as competition also incentivizes television stations to 
select programming responsive to the interests and needs of the local community.  In addition, we find 
that the Local Television Ownership Rule continues to be consistent with our goal of promoting minority 
and female ownership of broadcast television stations.  Moreover, we find that a limited modification of 
the rule�replacing the Grade B contour overlap test with a digital noise limited service contour (NLSC) 
overlap test�will better promote competition and reflect the current television marketplace, and that the 
benefits of this approach outweigh any burdens, which will be minimized by our decision to grandfather 
existing combinations as described below.  In addition, we retain the existing failed/failing station waiver 
policy.  Finally, we clarify the application of the top-four prohibition to �affiliation swaps� that would 
result in a single entity obtaining control over two of the top-four-rated stations in a market.  Overall, we 
find that the benefits of the rule we adopt today outweigh any burdens.      
18. Under our revised Local Television Ownership Rule, an entity may own up to two 
television stations in the same DMA if:  (1) the digital NLSCs of the stations (as determined by Section 
73.622(e) of the Commission�s rules) do not overlap; or (2) at least one of the stations is not ranked 
among the top-four stations in the market and at least eight independently owned television stations 
would remain in the DMA following the combination.37 In calculating the number of stations that would 
remain post-transaction, only those stations whose digital NLSCs overlap with the digital NLSC of at 
least one of the stations in the proposed combination will be considered.   
2. Background
19. In the FNPRM, the Commission proposed to retain the existing Local Television 
Ownership Rule, but with a single modification�replacing the analog Grade B contour overlap provision 
(i.e., the test for determining whether to apply the top-four prohibition and the eight-voices test) with a 
digital NLSC overlap test.38 The Commission proposed to retain the remainder of the rule, specifically, 
the top-four prohibition, the eight-voices test, and the numerical limits.39 In addition, the FNPRM sought 
comment on:  the application of the top-four prohibition to transactions commonly referred to as 
�affiliation swaps�; potential modifications to the failed/failing station waiver criteria; the impact of 
multicasting (including dual affiliations via multicasting) on local markets; and the impact of the 
proposed rule on minority and female ownership.40
20. Broadcast commenters generally oppose the retention of the Local Television Ownership 
Rule on the basis of its effect on small market television stations.41 In particular, Nexstar Broadcasting, 
Inc. (Nexstar) argues that the rule serves only to prevent television broadcasters in medium and small

markets from effectively competing with other integrated, multi-platform video programming 
distributors.42 Broadcasters state that the rules do more harm than good in smaller markets by preventing 
stations from realizing the benefits of joint ownership and sharing arrangements.43 The National 
Association of Broadcasters (NAB) also argues that the ownership rules do not promote the independent 
production of local news programming.44
21. Other commenters support the Commission�s proposal to retain the rules because of the 
continuing need to prevent excessive consolidation of television stations.45 Commenters supporting 
retention of the rule cite the increase in television consolidation both at the local and national levels that 
has adversely affected programming diversity.46  Free Press states that television consolidation results in 
the same company owning multiple media outlets in the same community such that changing the channel 
brings the same content from the same company, packaged with slightly different graphics and sometimes 
delivered by a different reporter.47  Free Press argues that the public interest in ensuring programming 
diversity should outweigh any efficiencies broadcasters claim are gained through consolidation and points 
out that broadcast television has an obligation to serve the public interest because of its use of the public 
airwaves and thus is not a purely commercial endeavor.48 It also questions broadcasters� arguments that 
efficiencies lead to public interest benefits such as additional local news programming.49  
3. Discussion
22. Section 202(h) of the 1996 Act requires the Commission to review whether the Local 
Television Ownership Rule continues to be �necessary in the public interest as a result of competition.�50  
For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the current rule, with the modifications and 
clarifications adopted herein, meets that standard.  We also conclude that it is appropriate to maintain the 
current television market definition and numerical limits on television ownership based on our 
examination of the record before us.  We modify the existing contour approach for application of the 
Local Television Ownership Rule by replacing the analog Grade B contour with the digital NLSC, while 
grandfathering any existing ownership combinations that exceed the numerical limits as a result of the 
change of methodology.  We retain the top-four prohibition and clarify that transactions involving 
changes of network affiliation must comply with the top-four prohibition.  We also retain the eight-voices 
test and the existing waiver standard.  Finally, we decline to regulate dual network affiliations via 
multicast at this time.  
23. Market.  The FNPRM tentatively found that the Local Television Ownership Rule 
continues to be necessary to promote competition among broadcast television stations in local television 
viewing markets.51 We also tentatively found that the video programming market remained distinct from

the radio listening market and declined to expand the market definition to include all forms of media.52  
We sought comment on these tentative conclusions.    
24. The Writers Guild of America, West, Inc. (WGAW) asserts that online video offerings 
are not yet meaningful substitutes for local broadcast television.  WGAW states that broadcast television 
continues to dominate in terms of total viewing hours and advertising revenue.  WGAW cites Pew�s State 
of the Media Report which found that broadcast television remains the primary news source for the 
majority of consumers.53 WGAW also argues that television remains the dominant platform for 
advertisers, representing $72 billion in revenue in 2013, while advertisers spent only approximately $3 
billion on online video advertising.54  
25. By contrast, several broadcast commenters argue that our market definition is outdated 
and that the video marketplace has expanded greatly to include online, cable, and direct-broadcast satellite 
(DBS) video offerings.55 Given the options that consumers have today compared to when the rules were 
last updated, Nexstar argues that the Commission should adopt a rule that ensures that local broadcasters, 
especially those in smaller markets, are governed by a rational rule that affords them the opportunity to 
compete effectively with all of the other video content providers.56 NAB argues that competition for 
audiences and advertisers from other sources of video�such as from multichannel video programming 
distributors (MVPDs) and from Internet and mobile video providers�creates adequate competitive 
pressures so that the harms associated with consolidation do not occur, especially in smaller markets.57  
Additionally, NAB objects to our proposed market definition and, in support of this opposition, submits a 
study that challenges the market definition used by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in its antitrust review 
by purporting to demonstrate that joint sales agreements and duopoly ownership arrangements have not 
resulted in increased advertising prices (the Singer/Caves study).58  
26. As discussed below, we find that the record supports the conclusion that non-broadcast 
video offerings still do not serve as meaningful substitutes for local broadcast television.59 Accordingly, 
our analysis regarding the Local Television Ownership Rule must continue to focus on promoting 
competition among broadcast television stations in local television viewing markets.  Competition within 
a local market motivates a broadcast television station to invest in better programming and to provide 
programming tailored to the needs and interests of the local community in order to gain market share.60  
By thus strengthening its position in the local market, a television broadcaster also strengthens its ability 
to compete for advertising revenue and retransmission consent fees, an increasingly important source of 
revenue for many stations.  As a result, viewers in the local market benefit from such competition among 
numerous strong rivals in the form of higher quality programming.

27. While we recognize the popularity of video programming delivered via MVPDs, the 
Internet, and mobile devices, we find that competition from such video programming providers remains 
of limited relevance for the purposes of our analysis.  Video programming delivered by MVPDs such as 
cable and DBS is generally uniform across all markets, as is online video programming content.  Unlike 
local broadcast stations, such programming providers are not likely to make programming decisions based 
on conditions or preferences in local markets.  No commenter in this proceeding offered evidence of non-
broadcast video programmers modifying their programming decisions based on the competitive 
conditions in a particular local market.  This strengthens our determination that, while non-broadcast 
video programming may offer consumers additional programming options in general, they do not serve as 
a meaningful substitute in local markets due to their national focus.  Unlike broadcast television stations, 
national programmers are not responsive to the specific needs and interests of local markets, and as the 
Commission has previously stated, competition among local rivals most benefits consumers and serves 
the public interest.61  
28. In addition, we find that broadcast television�s strong position in the local advertising 
market supports our view that non-broadcast video programming distributors are not meaningful 
substitutes in local television markets.  NAB argues that advertisers no longer distinguish local broadcast 
television from non-broadcast sources of video programming when choosing how to allocate spending for 
local advertising.62 The current data do not support this claim, as advertising revenues for broadcast 
television stations remain strong and are projected to grow through 2019.63 While advertising revenues 
on cable, satellite, and digital platforms have risen, those gains do not appear to be at the expense of 
broadcast television stations.64 We find that broadcast television continues to play a significant role in the 
local advertising market, particularly when it comes to political advertising.65
29. With regard to the Singer/Caves study, we do not find the study relevant or informative in 
this proceeding for multiple reasons.  First, we find significant issues with the statistical methods 
employed within the study and with the interpretation of those results.  For example, based on our 
analysis, the cross-sectional regression analyses are likely to suffer from missing variable bias that could 
reverse the results on which the authors rely.  The fixed effects regression analyses (which may mitigate 
these statistical issues) merely show a lack of statistical significance, which can result from measurement

4381-82, para. 24.  We note that the slight decline from 2012 to 2014 is likely attributed to the fact that 2012 was a 
presidential election year, in which political ad spending is generally higher than non-presidential election cycles.

issues or a lack of variation in the relevant variable, as opposed to a lack of a relationship, as the authors� 
interpret it.  Also, their measure of JSAs/SSAs is admittedly imprecise (except in one regression that 
shows a lack of statistical significance), and this kind of mismeasurement can lead to a host of statistical 
problems so that a regression based on imprecisely-measured data cannot be relied on.  In addition, the 
study critiques the local broadcast television market relied on by DOJ in its merger reviews pursuant to 
Section 7 of the Clayton Act�which focuses solely on the impact of the transaction in the local 
advertising market�and not the market definition relied on by the Commission for analyzing its Local 
Television Ownership Rule pursuant to Section 202(h), as discussed herein.  While the Commission�s 
market definition for purposes of the Local Television Ownership Rule is similar to the market definition 
used by DOJ when evaluating broadcast television mergers, in that the scope of our rule is limited to 
broadcasters, DOJ focuses on competition for advertising, whereas our rule is premised on multiple 
factors, including audience share.66 Therefore, we find that the Singer/Caves study does not inform the 
current proceeding.
30. Based on the record in this proceeding, we conclude that broadcast television stations 
continue to play a unique and vital role in local communities that is not meaningfully duplicated by non-
broadcast sources of video programming.  In addition to providing viewers with the majority of the most 
popular programming on television, broadcast television stations remain the primary source of local news 
and public interest programming.67 Moreover, 34 million Americans, or 10 percent of the United States 
population, lack broadband access at speeds sufficient to stream or download video programming 
available via the Internet.68 Accordingly, we conclude that, for purposes of determining whether our local 
TV rule remains necessary in the public interest, the relevant product market is the delivery of local 
broadcast television service.  Next, we evaluate whether the rule remains necessary in the public interest.
31. Contour Overlap/Grandfathering Existing Ownership Combinations.  The FNPRM 
proposed to retain the existing DMA and contour overlap approach for application of the Local Television 
Ownership Rule, as opposed to the DMA-only approach detailed in the NPRM.69 In addition, the FNPRM 
proposed to replace the analog Grade B contour with the digital NLSC and proposed to grandfather 
existing ownership combinations that would exceed the numerical limits under the revised approach.70  
No comments were submitted on this issue.

(2016) (2016 Broadband Progress Report) (finding that approximately 34 million (10 percent of) Americans lack

do not take the position that broadband deployment and adoption must be universal before we will consider Internet-
delivered video to be included in the market for the Local Television Ownership Rule, we find that the current level 
of penetration of broadband service remains relevant when considering the extent to which online platforms may be 
meaningful substitutes for local broadcast television stations.  The Report also found that, with regard to mobile 
broadband access, that 1.7 million (one percent of) Americans do not have access to a mobile provider using LTE 
technology, and that 171.5 million (53 percent of) Americans do not have access to mobile service provider with a

32. Consistent with our tentative conclusions in the FNPRM, we decline to adopt the DMA-
only approach.71 Instead, we will retain the existing DMA and contour overlap approach but replace the 
analog Grade B contour with the digital NLSC, which the Commission has treated as the functional 
equivalent of the Grade B contour in previous proceedings.72 We find that this modified approach 
accurately reflects current digital service areas while minimizing any potential disruptive impact.  In 
addition, consistent with previous Commission decisions, we find that retaining the DMA and contour 
overlap approach serves the public interest by promoting local television service in rural areas.73 That is, 
such an approach continues to allow station owners in rural areas to build or purchase an additional 
station in remote portions of the DMA, so long as there is no digital NLSC overlap.74  
33. We confirm that the digital NLSC is an accurate measure of a station�s current service 
area and thus is an appropriate standard.  It is important that the Local Television Ownership Rule take 
into account the current digital service area of a station.  Thus, we continue to define the geographic 
dimensions of the local television market by referring to DMAs under the modified rule we adopt today 
but replace the analog Grade B contour with the digital NLSC, with the effect that within a DMA an 
entity may own or operate two stations in a market if the digital NLSCs of those stations do not overlap.75  
  
71 No commenter advocated for the DMA-only approach.  
72 See, e.g., Stephen Diaz Gavin, Esq., Letter, 25 FCC Rcd 1851, 1857-58 (MB 2010); Advanced Television Systems 
and their Impact Upon the Existing Television Broadcast Service, Seventh Report and Order and Eighth Further 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 22 FCC Rcd 15581 (2007) (discussion of �DTV Power� in DTV Table Appendix 
B treats the Grade B and NLSC contours as comparable by using the Grade B contour for stations that did not have a 
DTV channel); Implementation of the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004, Report and
Order, 20 FCC Rcd 17278, 17292, para. 31 (2005); Second Periodic Review of the Commission�s Rules and Policies

Review of the Commission�s Rules and Policies Affecting the Conversion to Digital Television, Report and Order 
and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 16 FCC Rcd 5946, 5956, para. 22 (2001).  By contrast, there is no 
digital counterpart to a station�s analog city grade contour, which is an aspect of the Commission�s satellite station 
inquiry.  Accordingly, consistent with case law developed after the digital transition, we continue to evaluate all 
future requests for new or continued satellite status on an ad hoc basis.  See, e.g., Television Satellite Stations 
Review of Policy and Rules, Report and Order, 6 FCC Rcd 4212, 4213, paras. 3-4 (1991) (defining satellite stations 
and explaining how satellite stations are generally exempt from the ownership restrictions set forth in Section 
73.3555 (a)�(d) of the Commission�s rules) (subsequent history omitted) (Television Satellite Stations); HBK NV

2067-68, para. 104.  In the 2002 Biennial Review Order, in which the Local Television Ownership Rule was relaxed, 
the Commission eliminated the contour overlap provision and relied solely on DMAs.  2002 Biennial Review Order, 
18 FCC Rcd at 13691-92, paras. 185-87.  However, in recognition of the unique circumstances involving stations 
without Grade B contour overlap, the Commission adopted waiver criteria that would permit common ownership if 
the applicant could demonstrate �that the stations have no Grade B overlap and that the stations are not carried by 
any MVPD to the same geographic area.�  Id. at 13692, para. 187.  The revised rule adopted in the 2002 Biennial 
Review Order was overturned on appeal for reasons unrelated to the waiver criteria.  Prometheus I, 373 F.3d at 418-
21.  Because the waiver criteria were necessitated previously by the absence of a contour-overlap component in the 
rule and because we retain the existing DMA and contour overlap approach, we find that those criteria are 
unnecessary and therefore decline to consider or adopt such waiver criteria.  Furthermore, no commenter advocated 
for this alternate approach.  
74 See 2006 Quadrennial Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2068, para. 104.
75 The Commission previously determined that the DMA is the most appropriate definition of the geographic 
dimensions of the local television market, and we do not disturb that finding. 1999 Ownership Order, 14 FCC Rcd 
at 12926, para. 47.  The approach we adopt in this Order is consistent with our approach under the prior Local 
Television Ownership Rule.

Where digital NLSC overlap exists, the combination will be permitted only if it satisfies the top-four 
prohibition and the eight-voices test.
34. We also adopt the proposal to grandfather existing ownership combinations that would 
exceed the numerical limits by virtue of the revised contour approach instead of requiring divestiture.76  
Under these circumstances, we do not believe that compulsory divestiture is appropriate.77 We continue 
to believe that the disruption to the marketplace and hardship for individual owners resulting from forced 
divestiture of stations would outweigh any benefits of forced divestiture to our policy goals, including 
promoting ownership diversity.  Furthermore, we note that the replacing the Grade B contour with the 
digital NLSC�given the similarity in the contours�effectively maintains the status quo for most, if not 
all, owners of duopolies formed as a result of the previous Grade B contour overlap provision.
35. However, we conclude that where grandfathered combinations are sold, the ownership 
rule governing television stations in effect at the time of the sale must be complied with.  If the digital 
NLSC of two stations in the same DMA overlap, then the stations serve the same area, even if there was 
no Grade B contour overlap prior to the digital transition.  Accordingly, requiring that a grandfathered 
combination be brought into compliance with the new standard at the time of sale is consistent with our
rationale for adopting the digital NLSC-based standard and does not cause hardship by requiring 
premature divestiture.  Consistent with Commission precedent, we find that the public interest would not 
be served by allowing grandfathered combinations to be freely transferable in perpetuity where a 
combination does not comply with the ownership rules at the time of transfer or assignment.78
36. Numerical Limits.  The FNRPM tentatively found that the current numerical limits 
permitting the ownership of up to two stations in a market, or a �duopoly,� serves the public interest by 
allowing for efficiencies through owning more than one station while also promoting competition and 
diversity.79 We sought comment on whether to retain the existing numerical limits subject to the other 
requirements proposed in the FNPRM.80  
37. Free Press supports retention of the rule�s numerical limits but would prefer a return to 
the one station per market rule (or, single license rule) that was in effect prior to the relaxation of the 
Local Television Ownership Rule in 1999, which it asserts would free up stations for purchase by new 
entrants.81 Free Press contends that duopolies �have all but wiped out� diverse ownership in the large 
  
76 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4385, para. 33.
77 In the Local Radio Ownership Rule section, we confirm the disruptive impact of compulsory divestitures but 
determine that divestitures would be appropriate if we tightened the local radio ownership limits.  Infra para. 106.  
In adopting the digital NLSC standard, we are not reducing the number of stations that can be commonly owned by 
all licensees; rather, we are adopting a technical change that may result in a small number of station combinations no 
longer complying with the criteria necessary to permit such common ownership.  Accordingly, compulsory 
divestiture is not appropriate in these circumstances.

urban markets where they are currently permitted.82 Also, Free Press argues that multicasting eliminates 
the need to acquire an additional television station and that a single license rule would encourage a station 
to make more efficient use of its broadcast spectrum.83 In the absence of a return to the single license 
rule, Free Press urges the Commission not to relax the local television rule further, especially as local 
television remains a top source for news.84  
38. We conclude that the local television marketplace has not changed sufficiently to justify 
tightening the current numerical limits of the rule and returning to a single-license television rule.85 The 
data demonstrate that the duopolies permitted subject to the restrictions of the current rule have created 
tangible public interest benefits for viewers in local television markets that offset any potential harms that 
are associated with common ownership.86 Such benefits include substantial operating efficiencies, which 
potentially allow a local broadcast station to invest more resources in news or other public interest 
programming that meets the needs of its local community.87 Moreover, as discussed in greater detail in 
the paragraphs below on multicasting, we believe that the ability to multicast is not a substitute for 
common ownership of multiple stations and therefore does not justify tightening the existing numerical 
limits.
39. Likewise, we do not find that there have been sufficient changes in the local television 
marketplace to justify ownership of a third in-market station.  Commenters in favor of loosening the 
Local Television Ownership Rule cite growing competition from non-broadcast alternatives and the 
economic efficiencies of owning multiple stations as the reasons why the Commission should permit 
ownership of more than two stations.  As discussed above in connection with our decision to define the 
relevant product market as broadcast television, we conclude that it is not appropriate to consider 
competition from non-broadcast sources in evaluating whether the rule remains necessary.88 Despite the 
aforementioned benefits that duopolies can create, excessive consolidation remains likely to threaten the 
Commission�s competition and diversity goals by jeopardizing small and mid-sized broadcasters.  
Without significant evidence of the public interest benefits that could result from the ownership of three 
stations in a local market that are not already available from the ownership of two stations, we do not 
believe that there is adequate justification at this time for increasing the numerical limits.
40. Top-Four Prohibition.  The FNRPM proposed to retain the top-four prohibition, which 
prohibits mergers involving two top-four rated stations in a market, and it tentatively concluded that 
affiliation swaps should be subject to the top-four prohibition.89 We tentatively found that the top-four

prohibition remains necessary to promote competition in the local television marketplace, as mergers 
involving two of the top-four stations in a market would be the most deleterious to competition.90 In 
addition, we tentatively found that scenarios whereby a licensee could obtain control over two top-four 
stations in a market through a transaction or series of transactions, referred to as �affiliation swaps,� 
should be subject to the top-four prohibition, as these transactions would otherwise circumvent the intent 
of the top-four prohibition rule and are not in the public interest.91 We sought comment on the tentative 
decisions both to retain the existing prohibition and to apply the prohibition to affiliation swaps.92
41. The American Cable Association (ACA), United Church of Christ (UCC) et al., and 
WGAW support the Commission�s conclusion that the top-four prohibition remains necessary to preserve 
competition in local television markets.93 ACA states that mergers involving two top-four stations in a 
market would minimize competition between the commonly owned stations, and thereby reduce the 
incentives for each station to improve its programming.94 UCC et al. likewise argue that mergers between 
two top-four stations would result in a reduction of viewpoint diversity, competition, and localism by 
eliminating an important independent source of local news.95 WGAW states that television mergers and 
acquisitions in 2013 totaled $12.4 billion alone, compared to the total volume ($13.2 billion) over the last 
five years, and that these transactions have concentrated ownership among the largest broadcast group 
owners, such as Sinclair, Gray, and Nexstar.96 WGAW asserts that the Commission�s station ownership 
limits likely serve as the only measure preventing further concentration that would harm competition and, 
therefore, the public interest.97
42. Broadcast commenters, on the other hand, oppose retention of the top-four prohibition.  
NAB submits revenue data in support of its assertion that no significant break exists between the fourth 
and fifth ranked stations in a market.98 NAB argues that its data demonstrate the arbitrary nature of the 
top-four restriction and that a combination of two top-four stations would not harm competition in a local 
market.99 NAB argues that allowing two top-four stations to combine would enhance competition, 
especially in medium and small markets, by permitting the creation of a more viable competitor to higher 
ranked stations.100 Nexstar argues that common ownership leads to investment in better programming by 
maximizing owners� revenues from advertising and retransmission consent; therefore, the top-four

prohibition is detrimental to promoting the public interest.101 According to Nexstar, the top-four 
restriction rests on the Commission�s outdated findings and flawed assumptions regarding the incentives 
of commonly owned stations.102  
43. We conclude that the top-four prohibition remains necessary to promote competition in 
the local television marketplace; accordingly, we retain the top-four prohibition in the Local Television 
Ownership Rule.  First, we continue to find that audience share is the appropriate metric for purposes of 
the top-four prohibition, and the record does not offer persuasive reason to depart from this 
determination.103 Second, we find that there typically remains a significant �cushion� of audience share 
points that separates the top-four stations in a market from the fifth-ranked station.104 We are not 
persuaded by NAB�s assertions regarding the revenue of fourth- and fifth-ranked stations in a market.  As 
we noted in the FNPRM, NAB�s analysis evaluates revenue share and does not sufficiently examine 
audience share, which the Commission has utilized when evaluating the need for the top-four 
prohibition.105 We continue to find that it is the ability to attract mass audiences that distinguishes the top 
ranked stations in local television markets, which is why it is appropriate that ratings serve as the basis for 
the top-four prohibition.106 Therefore, NAB�s evidence does not disturb the Commission�s previous 
determinations that the relevant metric for purposes of the top-four prohibition is audience share and does

audiences away from competitors� programs. The additional incentives facing competitive rivals are more likely to 
improve program quality and create programming preferred by existing viewers.�); Prometheus I, 373 F.3d at 417-

104 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4390, para. 44 (citing Staff analysis of Nielsen audience share data that found a 
significant cushion between the fourth- and fifth-rated broadcast television stations in each DMA with at least five 
full-power television stations) ).  Further, the court has twice upheld the Commission�s rationale for retaining the 
top-four prohibition.  Prometheus II, 652 F.3d at 460-61; Prometheus I, 373 F.3d at 417-18.  We note that the 
Commission has never based the top-four prohibition solely on the existence of the ratings cushion in every market.  
In the 2002 Biennial Review Order, the Commission determined that the cushion existed in two-thirds of the 
markets with five or more full-power commercial television stations.  18 FCC Rcd at 13694-95, para. 195.  The 
court in Prometheus I cited specifically to this finding as evidence to support the Commission�s line-drawing 
decision.  373 F.3d at 418.  Therefore, we find unconvincing any claim that the top-four prohibition cannot be 
supported because the ratings cushion is not present in every market.  The cushion continues to exist in most 
markets and, as such, it continues to support our decision to retain the top-four prohibition.  See FNPRM, 29 FCC

not rebut the evidence in this proceeding that a cushion still exists between the fourth- and fifth-ranked 
stations in most markets.107
44. We reaffirm our belief that top-four combinations would generally result in a single firm 
obtaining a significantly larger market share than other firms in the market and that such combinations 
would create welfare harms.108 Top-four combinations reduce incentives for local stations to improve 
their programming by giving once strong rivals incentives to coordinate their programming in order to 
minimize competition between the commonly owned stations.109 We are not persuaded by Nexstar�s 
assertions that commonly owned stations have no incentive to coordinate their programming based solely 
on anecdotal showings from Nexstar-owned stations in two DMAs.110 While we recognize that duopolies 
permitted subject to the restrictions of the current rule can create operating efficiencies, which allow the 
commonly owned stations to invest in news and other local programming, we find that this potential 
benefit is outweighed by the harm to competition where a single firm obtains a significantly larger market 
share through a combination of two top-four stations.111 Accordingly, we find that the public interest is 
best served by retaining the top-four prohibition.112
45. Affiliation Swaps.  ACA, Block Communications, Inc. (Block), and UCC et al. support 
application of the top-four prohibition to affiliation swaps.  ACA states that affiliation swaps result in the 
identical harm the top-four prohibition is meant to prevent.113 ACA states that the Commission should 
prohibit affiliation swaps that result in an entity holding an attributable interest in two top-four stations in 
a local television market.114 Otherwise, ACA explains, an owner of a top-four station and a non-top-four 
ranked station can create a prohibited duopoly by swapping the affiliation of its previously non-top-four 
ranked station for a top-four network affiliation, thus, turning the second station into a top-four station in 
a market without opportunity for Commission review.115
46. Raycom Media, Inc. (Raycom) and LIN Television Corporation d/b/a LIN Media (LIN)

Commission�s proposed action as reversing course and asserts that it would constitute an unlawful 
interference in the network affiliation marketplace.116 Raycom characterizes the proposal described in the

FNPRM as amounting to content regulation since it would potentially prevent a non-top-four ranked 
station in a duopoly from obtaining certain content�namely content from the network affiliate of a top-
four ranked station.117 As support for its opposition to extending the top-four prohibition, Raycom cites 
the Commission�s statement in the 1999 Ownership Order that any entity acquiring a duopoly while 
complying with the top-four prohibition at the time of transaction would not be required to divest if the 
two merged stations both become ranked among the top-four stations in the market subsequent the 
transaction.118 In addition, LIN asserts that support by MVPDs for the application of the top-four 
prohibition to affiliation swaps is part of an ongoing effort by MVPDs to degrade the quality and variety 
of free, over-the-air programming.119 LIN argues that MVPDs naturally would be better served if 
broadcasters, which provide a free alternative to MVPDs, are limited to broadcasting less popular 
programming.120 LIN warns that, if the Commission permits MVPDs to degrade the quality and variety 
of programming available on free, over-the-air television, more content will move to behind the paywalls 
of MVPDs and wireless providers.121
47. We find that application of the top-four prohibition to affiliation swaps is consistent with 
previous Commission action and policy; we are merely closing a potential loophole and preventing 
circumvention of the Commission�s rules.122 In the 1999 Ownership Order that adopted the top-four 
prohibition, the Commission did not make a statement regarding its authority to require divestiture if two 
merged stations both became ranked among the top-four rated stations in the market; it stated only that it 
would refrain from doing so in order to further certain, specific public interest benefits.123 By allowing 
combinations between a large station and a small station, the Commission sought to enable the smaller 
station to improve its operations and local program offerings.124 The Commission wanted to avoid 
penalizing a station whose operations improved to the point that it became a top-four station.  By contrast,

121 Id.  We find LIN�s assertions unpersuasive because preventing affiliation swaps in the circumstances proposed 
would not impact the quality of network programming but merely require a different licensee to air the 
programming.  
122 Raycom states that the Commission has no explicit statutory authority to regulate affiliation swaps.  See Raycom 
NPRM Comments at 1-2.  However, parties can achieve through an affiliation swap the same result as a transfer of 
control or assignment of license, which would be subject to Commission review and be required to comply with the 
Local Television Ownership Rule.  See FNRPM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4391, para. 47.  Accordingly, absent our action 
today, parties could utilize affiliation swaps to achieve a result otherwise prohibited by the Local Television 
Ownership Rule.  Therefore, we find that our statutory authority to extend the Local Television Ownership Rule to 
include affiliation swaps derives from the same general rulemaking authority that supports all of our broadcast 
ownership rules, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly held.  FCC v. Nat�l Citizens Comm. for Broad., 436 U.S. 775, 
793-94 (1978) (holding that Section 303(r) and Section 4(i) of the Communications Act, 47 CFR �� 153(i), 303(r),  
provide authority for ownership rules restricting same-service ownership as well as newspaper-broadcast cross-

the Commission was concerned that mergers involving top-four stations would harm competition and 
viewpoint diversity.125 Affiliation swaps, by their design, implicate the specific harms to public interest 
that led the Commission to adopt the top-four prohibition.126  
48. Moreover, the Commission cautioned in 1999 that future transactions, such as license 
transfers, that do not satisfy the top-four prohibition may not be granted.127 This demonstrates that the 
Commission sought to distinguish instances where a station organically becomes a top-four station 
through station improvement from situations where a station actively transacts to become a top-four 
station via an ownership transfer or assignment.128 While it said that the top-four determination would be 
made at the time of the initial transaction, the Commission signaled its intent to review future transactions 
involving assignments or transfers of ownership resulting in a single entity owning two top-four stations 
in the same market.129 Although the Commission decided in 1999 not to prohibit licensees from owning 
two top-four stations when a station�s top-four status resulted from organic growth, transactions involving 
the sale or swap of network affiliations between in-market stations that result in an entity holding an 
attributable interest in two top-four stations serve as the functional equivalent of a transfer of control or 
assignment of license.130 Therefore, affiliation swaps undermine the purpose of the top-four prohibition 
and the Local Television Ownership Rule as a whole.  Application of the top-four prohibition to 
affiliation swaps is necessary to prevent circumvention of the Local Television Ownership Rule.  
  
125 Id. at 12933, para. 66.  
126 Id. (�The �top four ranked station� component of this standard is designed to ensure that the largest stations in the 
market do not combine and create potential competition concerns.  These stations generally have a large share of the 
audience and advertising market in their area, and requiring them to operate independently will promote 
competition.�).  Aside from the assignment/transfer of a station license, an affiliation swap is essentially 
indistinguishable in its effect on the policy underlying our duopoly rule from a top-four merger described by the 
Commission in the 1999 Ownership Order.  See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4391, para. 47 (�In general, national 
network affiliation is a significant driver of a station�s audience share. . . . Accordingly, an affiliation swap involving 
a top-four station and a non-top-four station will nearly always result in the non-top-four station becoming a top-four 
station after the swap.�).  If there is compelling evidence that an affiliation swap involving a top-four station and a 
non-top-four station would not result in the non-top-four station becoming a top-four station after the swap (e.g., a 
station�s top-four ratings are driven by non-network programming that is unaffected by the affiliation swap), the 
parties are free to seek a waiver of this prohibition under Section 1.3 of the Commission�s rules.  47 CFR � 1.3. 
127 1999 Ownership Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 12933, para. 64 (�[A] duopoly may not automatically be transferred to a 
new owner if the market does not satisfy the eight voice/top four-ranked standard.�).
128 See id. As we said in the FNPRM, acquiring control over a second in-market top-four station through affiliation 
swap transactions can be distinguished easily from other, legitimate actions a station may undertake to increase 
ratings at the expense of a competitor, such as producing higher quality or more extensive local programming or 
acquiring higher quality syndicated programming.  See FNRPM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4392, para. 50 n.126.  Moreover, 
the extension of the top-four prohibition we adopt today would not apply in situations where a network offers an 
existing duopoly owner (one top-four station and one station ranked outside the top four) a top-four-rated affiliation 
for the lower-rated station, perhaps because the network is no longer satisfied with the existing affiliate station and 
the duopoly owner has demonstrated superior station operation (i.e., earned the affiliation on merit).  Such a 
circumstance represents organic growth of the station and not a transaction that is the functional equivalent of an 
assignment or transfer of control.  
129 A contrary conclusion would greatly diminish the effectiveness of the top-four prohibition, as an entity could 
essentially transact to acquire a top-four station through an affiliation swap as soon as the Commission approved the 
initial duopoly.  See UCC et al. FNPRM Reply at 16 (�It would be irrational to interpret [the 1999 Ownership 
Order] as endorsing affiliation swaps given that they accomplish the exact same end that the top-four prohibition 
was intended to prevent.�).
130 See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4391, 4394, paras. 47, 50 n.127 (�The approach we propose today would clarify that 
the top-four prohibition would apply to certain agreements that are the functional equivalent of a transfer of control 
or assignment of license.�) (emphasis added).

49. We disagree with commenters that argue that extending the top-four prohibition to 
affiliation swaps amounts to impermissible content regulation and is subject to strict scrutiny.  The 
clarifying amendment adopted today does not regulate content any more than the top-four prohibition and 
the media ownership rules that consistently have been upheld by the courts, and it is therefore subject to 
rational basis review.  The decision to prohibit affiliation swaps involving two top-four stations, as 
described herein, does not consider content but rather the content�s ratings only.  In that regard, the 
extension of the top-four prohibition to affiliation swaps operates exactly as the existing top-four 
prohibition does.  The rule is predicated entirely on content-neutral objectives, primarily the public 
interest goal of promoting competition in local markets.  The rule does not limit a licensee�s discretion to 
air the content of its choice but rather limits the number of stations in a single market that a licensee may 
own if common ownership would result in significantly reduced competition.
50. The Prometheus II court found under the rational basis standard of review that the media 
ownership rules do not violate the First Amendment �because they are rationally related to substantial 
government interests in promoting competition and protecting viewpoint diversity.�131 The court rejected 
broadcasters� claims that the rules �are impermissible attempts by the FCC to manipulate content� and 
rejected Sinclair�s argument that the Local Television Ownership Rule �violates the First Amendment 
because it �singles out television stations.��132 Instead, the court recognized that �[t]hese rules apply 
regardless of the content of the programming.�133 The extension of the top-four prohibition that we adopt 
today merely clarifies that the top-four prohibition applies to agreements that are the functional equivalent 
of a transfer of control or assignment of license from the standpoint of our Local Television Ownership 
Rule.134 Accordingly, this application of the top-four prohibition remains subject to the same 
constitutional analysis, and the amended rule is rationally related to the substantial government interests 
in promoting competition and diversity.  Pursuant to that constitutional analysis, courts repeatedly have 
found that the Local Television Ownership Rule, which includes the top-four prohibition, does not violate 
the First Amendment.135
51. We also disagree that extension of the top-four prohibition constitutes unlawful 
interference in the network affiliation marketplace.  Raycom argues that extending the top-four 
prohibition to affiliation swaps would prevent a non-top-four ranked station in a duopoly from negotiating 
to obtain packages of content from other in-market stations merely because the content sought is too 
popular.136 We do not believe that our action is likely to have a significant impact on the marketplace, as 
affiliation swaps are, at this point, rare.137 Evidence in the record demonstrates that the negotiation of 
affiliation agreements typically does not involve affiliation swaps; therefore, most negotiations will be 
unaffected by our amendment clarifying the top-four prohibition.138 While affiliation swaps have not

occurred often to date, given the potential of such transactions to undermine the Local Television 
Ownership Rule, we find that the application of the top-four prohibition to such transactions is necessary 
to ensure the continued effectiveness of that rule.139 Such action is necessary because we do not believe 
there is a reliable marketplace solution that would restrain the future use of affiliation swaps to evade the 
top-four prohibition should we now decline to extend the top-four prohibition to affiliation swaps, nor is 
there a less restrictive means to accomplish our goal.140
52. Accordingly, in order to close this loophole, we find that affiliation swaps must comply 
with the top-four prohibition at the time the agreement is executed.  Specifically, an entity will not be 
permitted to directly or indirectly own, operate, or control two television stations in the same DMA 
through the execution of any agreement (or series of agreements) involving stations in the same DMA, or
any individual or entity with a cognizable interest in such stations, in which a station (the �new affiliate�) 
acquires the network affiliation of another station (the �previous affiliate�), if the change in network 
affiliations would result in the licensee of the new affiliate, or any individual or entity with a cognizable 
interest in the new affiliate, directly or indirectly owning, operating, or controlling two of the top-four 
rated television stations in the DMA at the time of the agreement.141 We will find any party that directly 
or indirectly owns, operates, or controls two top-four stations in the same DMA as a result of such 
transactions to be in violation of the top-four prohibition and subject to enforcement action.142  
53. Eight-Voices Test.  In the FNRPM, we proposed to retain the eight-voices test.  We 
tentatively concluded that a merger between two in-market stations with overlapping contours should 
continue to be prohibited unless at least eight independently owned commercial and noncommercial 
television stations remain in the market post-transaction, and at least one station involved in the 
transaction is not a top-four station.143 We sought comment on this proposal.  
54. UCC et al. and WGAW support retention of the eight-voices test as part of their support 
for retaining the existing ownership rules.  UCC et al. assert that in markets with eight or fewer 
independent owners the loss of one or more stations would present serious harms to competition and 
diversity.144  WGAW states that ongoing consolidation in the broadcast station market makes the 
Commission�s limits on station ownership increasingly relevant.145
55. NAB, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (Sinclair), and Nexstar oppose retention of the 
eight-voices test.  For example, NAB argues that many small markets do not have stations affiliated with 
all four major networks, let alone any additional stations, and that even some stations affiliated with major 
networks often struggle to maintain profitability.146 NAB states that the eight-voices test prevents stations

in smaller markets from forming efficient, profitable ownership structures.147 Sinclair asserts that, 
because not all markets have at least eight stations and the Commission has not allotted at least eight 
stations in all markets, no harm can come from having fewer than eight independent television voices in 
certain other markets.148  
56. We do not find that there have been any changes in the local television marketplace that 
would warrant modification of the eight-voices test at this time.149 Nearly every market with eight or 
more full-power television stations�absent a waiver of the Local Television Ownership Rule or unique 
circumstances�continues to be served by each of the Big Four networks and at least four independent 
competitors unaffiliated with a Big Four network.150 Competition among these independently owned

economic study�commissioned from the same authors of the Singer/Caves Study�offering a new argument for 
elimination of the eight-voices test. Letter from Rick Kaplan, General Counsel and Executive Vice President, and 
Jerianne Timmerman, Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, NAB, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, 
FCC, at 2, Attach. at 3 (July 19, 2016). In response, UCC et al. argue that the study should not be considered in this 
proceeding as it constitutes a substantive comment filed well after the comment period had closed. Letter from 
Andrew Jay Schwartzman et al., Counsel, UCC et al., to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, at 1-2 (July 22, 2016) 
(citing 47 C.F.R. �1.415(d) (�No additional comments may be filed [after the close of the comment period] unless 
specifically requested or authorized by the Commission.�)); see also id. at 3 (arguing that even if considered by the 
Commission, cursory review of the study shows that it fails to undermine the Commission�s public interest 
justification for the eight-voices test). UCC et al. add that NAB�s belated submission on July 19, 2016, is especially 
inappropriate given that the Commission had publicly committed (as far back as early 2014) to circulating a draft 
order in this proceeding by June 30, 2016, and had, in fact, circulated a draft order on June 27, 2016. Id. at 2 (noting 
that �NAB is one of the parties appealing the FCC�s failure to complete the 2010 Quadrennial Review�). UCC et al. 
further assert that consideration of the study at this point would require a reasonable period for review and comment 
by interested parties, which would result in an unreasonable delay in the completion of this proceeding.  Id. at 4.  
NAB responds that its economic submission is not a new substantive argument but rather supports statements NAB 
has previously made.  Letter from Rick Kaplan, General Counsel and Executive Vice President, and Jerianne 
Timmerman, Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, NAB, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, at 1-
2 (July 28, 2016) (NAB July 28 Ex Parte Letter).  We agree with UCC et al. that it would be inappropriate to 
consider NAB�s late-filed study in this proceeding.  While the Commission has an obligation to respond to all 
significant comments filed during the comment period, Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass�n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1203, 
191 L. Ed. 2d 186 (2015), it is not obligated to consider late-filed comments.  Verizon v. FCC, 770 F.3d 961, 968 
(D.C. Cir. 2014); see also Globalstar, Inc. v. FCC, 564 F.3d 476, 484 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Commission lacked �fair 
opportunity� to pass on new argument raised on the same day an order was adopted).  Here, NAB submits a 
complex econometric study that would require significant Commission resources and time to properly evaluate, as 
well as a reasonable opportunity for interested parties to comment.  NAB has not provided an adequate justification 
for submitting this study so egregiously late�indeed, after it knew the Report and Order had already been circulated 
and after there were reports that three Commissioners had voted for the item.  While NAB states that the study �took 
longer to complete, given the extensive data acquisition from multiple sources needed to conduct the study,� we note 
that the study could have been conducted at any time during the proceeding, and NAB has not explained why it 
initiated the study at such a late stage.  See NAB July 28 Ex Parte Letter at 2.  Nor has NAB explained how further 
delaying this proceeding is consistent with its own criticisms that the Commission has failed to resolve this 
proceeding in a timely manner.  Ultimately, we find that consideration of this extremely late-filed study would cause 
undue delay and would be contrary to the Third Circuit�s expectation that the Commission will move quickly to 
resolve this proceeding and the Commission�s commitment to do so.  See Prometheus III, 824 F.3d at 53-54.  
Therefore, we decline to consider it.

stations serves an important function by motivating both the major network stations and the independent 
stations to improve their programming, including increased local news and public interest 
programming.151 This competition is especially valuable during the parts of the day in which local 
broadcast stations do not transmit the programming of affiliated broadcast networks and rely on local 
content uniquely relevant to the stations� communities.
57. We continue to believe the minimum threshold maintained by the eight-voices test helps 
to ensure robust competition among local television stations in the markets where common ownership is 
permitted under the rule.  The eight-voices test increases the likelihood that markets with common 
ownership will continue to be served by stations affiliated with each of the Big Four networks as well as 
at least four independently owned and operated stations unaffiliated with these major networks.152 Also, 
because a significant gap in audience share persists between the top-four stations in a market and the 
remaining stations in most markets�demonstrating the dominant position of the top-four-rated stations in 
the market�we continue to believe that it is appropriate to retain the eight-voices test, which helps to 
promote at least four independent competitors for the top-four stations before common ownership is 
allowed.153 Accordingly, we retain the eight-voices test. 
58. We also sought comment on whether the Sinclair opinion compels us to include other 
voices in addition to full-power television stations in the eight-voices test.154 We find that it does not.  In 
Sinclair, the court rejected the eight-voices test, finding that the Commission had failed to justify its 
decision to define voices differently in the radio-television cross-ownership rule and the Local Television 
Ownership Rule.155  As stated above, the primary purpose of the Local Television Ownership Rule and the 
eight-voices test is to promote competition among broadcast television stations in local television viewing 
markets.156 By contrast, the primary purpose of the radio-television cross-ownership rule is to promote 
viewpoint diversity;157 therefore, it is appropriate to consider a broader range of voices there than in the 
context of the Local Television Ownership Rule.  Accordingly, we continue to include only full-power 
television stations in the voice count for purposes of the Local Television Ownership Rule.  
59. We note that our conclusion adheres to Prometheus II, where the court upheld the 
Commission�s rationale in the 2006 Quadrennial Review proceeding for limiting voices in the Local 
Television Ownership Rule to full-power television stations.  The Commission had determined in that 
proceeding that the primary goal of the Local Television Ownership Rule was to promote competition 
among local television stations, and not to foster viewpoint diversity because there were other outlets for 
diversity of viewpoint in local markets.  Therefore, although other types of media contribute to viewpoint

152 Id. at 2044-45, 2065, paras. 60, 99 (providing the rationale for selecting the number eight as the appropriate 
benchmark for the major media voice count).  In addition, we disagree with Sinclair�s interpretation that the eight-
voices test implies that at least �eight competing over-the-air TV stations are the minimum necessary to ensure 
competition� and so each market must have at least eight independent stations.  See Sinclair FNPRM Comments at 
8.  The eight-voices test only establishes the minimum level necessary to permit common ownership of stations in a 
market, subject to the other requirements in the rule.  Therefore, markets with fewer than eight independent stations 
can still maintain a significant level of competition given the absence of duopolies in these markets.

diversity, the Commission determined that they should not be counted as voices under the Local 
Television Ownership Rule.158 The court agreed and upheld the Commission�s decision.159  
60. Attribution of Television JSAs.  In the Report and Order, we adopted a rule that attributed 
television JSAs under which a television station (the broker) sold more than 15 percent of the weekly 
advertising time for another same-market television station (the brokered station).  Pursuant to the new 
rule, in such circumstances, the brokering station was deemed to hold an attributable interest in the 
brokered station.  Among other implications associated with attribution, this resulted in counting the 
brokered station toward the brokering station�s permissible ownership totals.160 In addition, we provided 
a two-year period from the effective date of the Report and Order (March 31, 2014) for parties to 
existing, same-market television JSAs whose attribution resulted in a violation of the ownership limits to 
terminate or amend those JSAs or otherwise come into compliance with the ownership rules.161  
Following the adoption of the Report and Order, Congress twice extended this compliance period, 
ultimately extending the relief through September 30, 2025.162
61. The Third Circuit vacated the Television JSA Attribution Rule in Prometheus III, finding 
that the adoption of the rule was procedurally invalid as a result of the Commission�s failure to also 
determine that the Local Television Ownership Rule served the public interest.163 The court stated that 
the Commission could readopt the rule if it was able to justify readopting the ownership rules to which 
television JSA attribution applies or to adopt new ownership rules.164 The court specifically noted that it 
�offer[ed] no opinion� on substantive challenges to the Television JSA Attribution Rule.165
62. Consistent with Prometheus III, having concluded that the Local Television Ownership 
Rule (with minor modifications) continues to serve the public interest, we now readopt the Television 
JSA Attribution Rule first adopted in the Report and Order.166 In so doing, we incorporate by reference 
the rationale articulated in the Report and Order for the adoption and application of the rule.167 We 
continue to find that it is appropriate to attribute certain television JSAs under the Commission�s 
attribution standards.168 We find that readopting the rule serves the public interest by ensuring

160 Report and Order, 29 FCC Rcd at 4527, para. 340.  While one purpose of the attribution rules is to determine 
compliance with the Commission�s various broadcast ownership rules, including the Local Television Ownership 
Rule, we note that the Commission�s attribution rules are relevant in many other contexts, as well (e.g., Form 323 
ownership reporting, auctions, retransmission consent negotiations, and foreign ownership).  But see Prometheus III, 
824 F.3d at 59 (asserting that if there were no ownership caps, the Commission would not need to have attribution 
rules).  Accordingly, even if the Commission were to eliminate all its ownership caps, the attribution rules would 
remain relevant in connection with a large number of other rules.  As such, it is important that the Commission 
retain the ability to update its attribution rules, as appropriate.

compliance with our broadcast ownership rules, and there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that the 
attribution of television JSAs has helped promote minority and female ownership opportunities.169
63. In addition, we are adopting different transition procedures than those adopted in the 
Report and Order.  Specifically, we retain the previous effective date for application of the grandfathering 
relief�March 31, 2014�and we will extend the compliance period through September 30, 2025.170 Until 
that time, such grandfathered agreements will not be counted as attributable, and parties will be permitted 
to transfer or assign these agreements to other parties without terminating the grandfathering relief.171  
While we note that this grandfathering relief is not typical of the relief normally provided by the 
Commission�generally grandfathered combinations cannot be assigned or transferred unless they 
comply with the ownership rules in effect at the time172�we believe that the relief is warranted given the 
various expressions of Congressional will in this regard.173
64. In addition to readopting the Television JSA Attribution Rule, we find that such 
attribution does not change our determination here that the existing Local Television Ownership Rule 
should be retained, with a minor contour modification.174 The analysis underlying the various 
components of the Local Television Ownership Rule (e.g., the numerical limits, the top-four prohibition, 
and the eight-voices test) assumes that independently owned and operating stations are just that�
independent.  The Commission�s attribution rules are designed to help to ensure that independence, or, 
stated differently, to reflect a determination of when stations are not truly independent, because of 
common ownership or other relationships that provide the ability to exercise influence or control over 
another station�s core operating functions.175 The attribution of certain television JSAs, which prevents

JSAs in the diversity context, see paragraph 238, infra.
170 Any television JSAs adopted or revised following the Third Circuit�s decision to vacate the Television JSA 
Attribution Rule are not provided any transition relief and must immediately be brought into compliance with the 
Commission�s rules.  This is consistent with the treatment of television JSAs executed after the release of the Report 
and Order, which were not provided any transition period.  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4542, para. 367 n.1130.  We 
believe that it is reasonable to adopt a similar measure here given that parties were on notice following Prometheus 
III that the Commission could readopt the Television JSA Attribution Rule if the Commission were to conclude, 
following completion of its Section 202(h) review, that the existing Local Television Ownership Rule should be 
retained or replaced with a new rule�which we have done herein.  See Prometheus III, 824 F.3d at 60.
171 In addition, any television JSA that previously lost grandfathering relief as a result of a condition imposed by the 
Commission in the approval of a transaction may seek to have the condition rescinded.  Upon request of the 
transferee or assignee of the station license, we will rescind the condition and permit the licensees of the stations 
whose advertising was jointly sold pursuant to such agreement to enter into a new JSA�to the extent that both 
parties wish to enter into the agreement�on substantially similar terms and conditions as the prior agreement.  We 
delegate authority to the Media Bureau to review these requests and grant relief, as appropriate.

analysis focuses on concepts that are generally applicable across all markets.  In response to the NOI, broadcast

those agreements from being used to circumvent the ownership limits by compromising the independence 
of a same-market station, helps to ensure that the goals of the Local Television Ownership Rule are 
realized.176 The Commission�s responsibility under Section 202(h) is to ensure that the Local Television 
Ownership Rule continues to serve the public interest, not to manipulate the rule to counterbalance the 
attribution of television JSAs.  As discussed in this section, we find that the rule we adopt here serves the 
public interest.            
65. Waiver Policy.  The FNPRM proposed to keep the existing failing/failed station waiver 
test and sought comment on whether to relax the criteria or to establish additional grounds for waiver.177  
We tentatively concluded that a market size waiver standard is not necessary.  Instead, we found that 
retention of the existing failed/failing station waiver policy would serve the public interest.178 Under this 
policy, to obtain a waiver of the local television rule, an applicant must demonstrate that one of the 
broadcast television stations involved in the proposed transaction is either failed or failing and that the in-
market buyer is the only reasonably available candidate willing and able to acquire and operate the 
station; and selling the station to an out-of-market buyer would result in an artificially depressed price.179  
A station is considered to be �failed� if it has not been in operation due to financial distress for at least 
four consecutive months immediately prior to the application, or is a debtor in an involuntary bankruptcy 
or insolvency proceeding at the time of the application; a television station is considered to be �failing� if 
it has an all-day audience share of no more than four percent and it has had negative cash flow for three 
consecutive years immediately prior to the application.180 We sought further comment on whether we 
should relax the waiver criteria or establish additional grounds for waiver.181
66. NAB opposes retention of the current failed/failing station waiver criteria.  NAB 
proposes that the Commission change the waiver test by:  (1) eliminating the four percent audience share 
standard and basing waiver eligibility on financial factors, (2) requiring a showing of only one year of 
(Continued from previous page)    
commenters expressed support for this approach, noting that a bright-line rule provides transaction participants with 
greater certainty and predictability, which in turn reduces transaction costs and expedites the Commission�s review 
process.  See NAB NOI Comments at 91; Hearst NOI Comments at 6-7.  The bright-line approach, however, 
precludes full �consideration of changing economic conditions within a particular local market or all of the 
variations that may exist across markets.�  NOI, 25 FCC Rcd at 6114, para. 92.  To take account of such 
considerations, the Commission would need to adopt a case-by-case approach.  However, such an approach provides 
less certainty to the market, imposes higher administrative burdens on the Commission than the bright-line 
approach, and may delay Commission decision-making, which could ultimately chill marketplace activity.  Id. at 
6115, paras. 93-94.  We do not find any support in the record for such an approach.  Accordingly, arguments that the 
Commission�s analysis regarding the Local Television Ownership Rule and/or television JSAs fails to account for 
market-by-market differences are unavailing, as an approach that takes those differences into account would be 
inconsistent with the bright-line rule favored by broadcasters.           
176 We note that this applies to any circumstances in which an individual or entity has an attributable interest in more 
than one station in a market.  The arguments that television JSAs should not be attributed because they produce 
public interest benefits are essentially indistinguishable from arguments that the ownership limits should be relaxed 
because common ownership produces public interest benefits.  We acknowledge and address these arguments 
throughout; however, we have ultimately determined that the Local Television Ownership Rule should be retained, 
with a minor modification to the contour standard.

negative cash flow, and (3) adopting a 180-day shot clock for waiver request reviews.182 However, UCC 
et al. argue that NAB�s proposal for a one-year negative cash flow requirement would not sufficiently 
demonstrate that a station is failing due to the cyclical nature of the broadcast industry.183 UCC et al. 
therefore supports retention of the current waiver criteria.184
67. Waiver of our rules is meant to be exceptional relief, and we find that the existing waiver 
criteria effectively establish when relief from the rule is appropriate.  We remain concerned that loosening 
the existing failed/failing station waiver criteria�such as by eliminating the four percent audience share 
requirement or by reducing the negative cash flow period from three years to one�would result in a 
waiver standard that is more vulnerable to manipulation by parties seeking to obtain a waiver.  Also, such 
changes may not be rationally related to improving the Commission�s ability to evaluate the viability of a 
station subject to the waiver request.  For example, we agree that examination of a station�s cash flow for 
only one year does not adequately account for the cyclical nature of broadcast television and would not 
necessarily indicate that a station is failing.185 A petitioner thus would increase the likelihood of a waiver 
petition being granted simply by timing the waiver petition to coincide with a station�s cyclical downturn.  
We anticipate that adopting the waiver standard proposed by NAB would significantly expand the 
circumstances in which a waiver of the Local Television Ownership Rule would be granted, without 
sufficiently demonstrating that the stations could not effectively compete in the market.  Such relaxation 
of the waiver standard would be inconsistent with our determination that the public interest is best served 
by retaining the existing television ownership limits in order to promote competition.  Therefore, we 
conclude that the existing waiver standard is not unduly restrictive and that it provides appropriate relief 
in all television markets.186  
68. Multicasting.  We tentatively concluded in the FNPRM that the ability to multicast 
multiple program streams on a digital broadcast television signal does not justify imposition of a ban on 
owning more than one station in a market.  In addition, the FNPRM tentatively declined to regulate dual 
affiliations via multicast at this time.187 The FNPRM sought comment on these tentative decisions and on 
any new developments that would require re-evaluation of our conclusions.188
69. LIN and Sinclair support the Commission�s proposal not to regulate dual affiliations via 
multicast.  LIN characterizes MVPD support for Commission action to restrict broadcasters� ability to

186 We also decline to adopt a 180-day shot clock for waiver request reviews.  See NAB FNPRM Comments at 60-
61. NAB does not provide any evidence that waiver requests are subject to undue delay; on the contrary, we believe 
that the current process works effectively and that applications are processed in a timely and efficient manner.  In 
addition, we note that the Commission currently endeavors to complete action on assignment and transfer of control 
applications (including those requesting a failed/failing station waiver) within 180 days of the public notice 
accepting the applications.  Routine applications are typically decided within the 180-day mark, and all applications 
are processed expeditiously as possible consistent with the Commission�s regulatory responsibilities.  However, 
several factors could cause the Commission�s review of a particular application to exceed 180 days.  See FCC,

Relating to Complex Mergers, https://www.fcc.gov/general/informal-timeline-consideration-applications-transfers-

choose programming as an effort to degrade the quality and variety of free, over-the-air programming.189  
Sinclair states that the Commission has approved of its multicasting practices and questions why the 
Commission permits multicasting but restricts ownership of multiple stations.190
70. ACA, Block, and Free Press oppose the Commission�s tentative conclusions.  ACA and 
Block concede that benefits can accrue from dual affiliations in smaller markets or markets with unique 
characteristics that leave them unable to carry all Big Four networks on separate full-power television 
stations.  However, they nevertheless argue that the potential harm of dual Big Four affiliations in larger 
markets warrants Commission action.191 ACA and Block state that dual affiliation through multicasting, 
especially of two top-four network affiliates, creates the same harm that the duopoly prohibition aims to 
prevent and that control over multiple Big Four networks via multicasting could result in higher 
retransmission consent fees, which would harm consumers.192 ACA proposes that the Commission 
prohibit dual affiliations via multicast of two top-four networks unless there is an insufficient number of 
full-power commercial television broadcast stations in a DMA to affiliate with each of the top four 
networks separately.193 Free Press cites Sinclair�s argument as an implicit concession that multicasting is 
practically the same as dual ownership.194
71. We find that the ability to multicast does not justify tightening the current numerical 
limits.  Based on evidence in the record, broadcasting on a multicast stream does not typically produce the 
cost savings and additional revenue streams that can be achieved by owning a second in-market station.195  
Therefore, tightening the numerical limits might prevent those broadcasters in markets where common 
ownership is permitted under the existing rule from achieving the efficiencies and related public interest 
benefits associated with common ownership.  Accordingly, our view, based on the most recent record, is 
that it is not appropriate to adjust the numerical limits as a result of stations� multicasting capability.
72. As proposed in the FNPRM, we decline to regulate dual affiliations via multicast, 
including dual affiliation with more than one Big Four network, at this time.  A significant benefit of the 
multicast capability is the ability to bring more local network affiliates to smaller markets, thereby 
increasing access to popular network programming and local news and public interest programming 
tailored to the specific needs and interests of the local community.  We find that the strongest public 
interest concerns posed by dual affiliations via multicasting involve affiliations between two Big Four 
networks.  However, based on the record, dual affiliations involving two Big Four networks via 
multicasting are generally limited to smaller markets where there are not enough full-power commercial 
television stations to accommodate each Big Four network or where there are other unique marketplace 
factors responsible for creating the dual affiliation.196 Marketplace incentives, at present, appear to limit 
the occurrence of dual affiliations via multicasting involving multiple Big Four networks largely to these 
smaller markets.197 Therefore, we conclude that the nature of the local television market supports our 
decision to decline regulation of dual affiliations via multicasting at this time.198 However, we will

continue to monitor this issue and take action in the future, if appropriate; moreover, we note that the 
Commission has the ability to consider issues that impact the Commission�s policy goals in the context of 
individual transactions such as transfers of control or assignments of licenses.199  
73. Minority and Female Ownership.  The FNPRM tentatively concluded that the proposed 
Local Television Ownership Rule was consistent with the Commission�s goal to promote minority and 
female ownership of broadcast television stations and sought comment on the potential impact of the 
incentive auction on minority and female ownership and whether that impact should affect the 2014 
Quadrennial Review.200
74. UCC et al. state that the spectrum auctions will have a negative effect on ownership 
opportunities for minorities and women because of the loss of spectrum for low power television (LPTV) 
stations.201 UCC et al. do not believe that retaining the existing ownership rules is enough to safeguard 
minority and female ownership from broadcast consolidation.202 The Smaller Market Coalition argues 
that more flexible ownership and operating arrangements (e.g., JSAs and SSAs) would increase minority 
and female ownership,203 a contention that has been much disputed in the record.204
75. We affirm our tentative conclusion that the current rule remains consistent with the 
Commission�s goal to promote minority and female ownership of broadcast television stations.  While we 
retain the existing Local Television Ownership Rule for the reasons stated above, to promote competition 
among broadcast television stations in local markets, and not with the purpose of preserving or creating 
specific amounts of minority and female ownership, we find that retaining the existing rule nevertheless 
(Continued from previous page)    
television stations rated in the top four in the market in violation of the Local Television Ownership Rule, which is 
the case with affiliation swaps now subject to the top-four prohibition, and there are no marketplace forces that 
would limit affiliation swaps absent our action today.  Indeed, considering the marketplace conditions that tend to 
give rise to dual affiliations, prohibiting dual affiliation with more than one Big Four network could result in some 
Big Four networks becoming unavailable over the air in certain markets because there are not enough commercial 
television stations to accommodate each Big Four network in these markets.  Prohibiting affiliation swaps would not 
create such a result since affiliation swaps, by definition, involve separate licensees affiliated with each network.

promotes opportunities for diversity in local television ownership.205 The competition-based rule helps to 
ensure the presence of independently owned broadcast television stations in the local market, thereby 
indirectly increasing the likelihood of a variety of viewpoints and preserving ownership opportunities for 
new entrants.206  
76. We are unconvinced by the Smaller Market Coalition�s argument that sharing 
agreements, such as JSAs and SSAs, promote minority and female ownership.207 While the record 
demonstrates that some stations that are owned by minorities and women participate in JSAs, the record 
also indicates that many such stations do not.208 Moreover, there is no evidence that current minority or 
female station owners utilized such agreements to acquire those stations.  To the contrary, anecdotal 
evidence suggests that JSAs, in particular, have been used by large station owners to foreclose entry into 
markets and that the Commission�s decision to attribute JSAs has actually led to greater ownership 
diversity209�a proposition supported by multiple commenters throughout this proceeding.210 As 
discussed in Section V, many joint operating agreements are not attributable under the Commission�s 
current rules, allowing for a meaningful level of cooperation for cost-saving purposes so long as the 
independence of the brokered station is preserved.  Therefore, the Commission�s rules do not prevent 
minority- and women-owned entities or other small business owners or new entrants from utilizing such 
agreements to facilitate station ownership, to the extent that such agreements are beneficial and do not 
result in ownership rule violations.
77. Additionally, we find the claim that tightening the Local Television Ownership Rule will 
promote increased opportunities for minority and female ownership to be both speculative and 
unsupported by existing ownership data.211 The National Telecommunications and Information 
  
205 We note also that we retain without modification the current failed/failing station waiver policy, including the 
requirement that the waiver applicant attempt to first solicit an out-of-market buyer, which promotes possible new 
entry in a market by ensuring that out-of-market entities interested in purchasing a station are aware of station sale 
opportunities.  See 1999 Ownership Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 12937, para. 74.
206 See Media Ownership Study 9, A Theoretical Analysis of the Impact of Local Market Structure on the Range of 
Viewpoints Supplied 2-3, by Isabelle Brocas, Juan D. Carrillo, and Simon Wilkie (2011) (Media Ownership Study 
9) (finding, based on theoretical analysis, that the presence of more independently owned outlets can increase 
viewpoint diversity in a market).  Premised on the reasonable assumption that more than one viewpoint exists on 
many issues, Media Ownership Study 9 supports the related conclusion that competition among firms with similar 
viewpoints improves information transmission.  Id. at 26-27.  Similarly, Media Ownership Study 2 examines the 
effects of media market structure on consumer demand and welfare, finding that �the representative consumer 
values different viewpoints in the reporting of information on news and current affairs, more information on 
community news, and more information that reflects the interests of women and minorities.�  Media Ownership 
Study 2, Consumer Valuation of Media as a Function of Local Market Structure 0, by Scott J. Savage and Donald 
M. Waldman (2011) (Media Ownership Study 2).  It finds, using simulation techniques, that any negative effects on 
diversity associated with common ownership of television stations in a market are smaller in markets with multiple 
independent television voices.  See Media Ownership Study 2 at 49.
207 We discuss sharing agreements in Section V.
208 See Smaller Market Coalition FNPRM Comments at 13-14.  The Smaller Market Coalition provides statistics 
regarding only full power television stations owned by women and African Americans.  By their own data, the 
majority of stations owned by women do not participate in JSAs; moreover, they do not offer any statistics for 
stations owned by other minority groups, which make up the largest portion of minority station owners.  See 2014

32
Administration (NTIA) ownership data from 1990-2000 identified 32 minority-owned full power 
television stations in 1998 (racial and ethnic minorities)�the year before the Commission relaxed the 
former rule that had restricted ownership to a single television station in a market.212 Following a decline 
in the 1999/2000 NTIA data to 23 stations,213 the Commission�s recent Form 323 ownership data 
demonstrate that minority ownership has grown since that rule was eliminated:  60 stations in 2009; 70 
stations in 2011; and 83 stations in 2013.214 Data provided by Free Press similarly show an increase in 
minority ownership after the Commission relaxed the Local Television Ownership Rule in 1999.215 No 
data provided in the record support a contention that the duopoly rule has reduced minority ownership or 
suggest that a return to the one-to-a-market rule would increase ownership opportunities for minorities 
and women.  
78. On the other hand, while the data reflect an increase in minority ownership following 
relaxation of the Local Television Ownership Rule, we have no evidence in the record that would permit 
us to infer causation and thus we decline to loosen the rule on this basis.    
79. Finally, we find that it is impossible at the present time to analyze the implications of the 
incentive auction for the Local Television Ownership Rule generally, or minority and female ownership 
specifically.216 In the auction proceeding, the Commission has considered the effects of the auction on 
diversity, stating that �[v]oluntary participation in the reverse auction, via a channel sharing, ultra-high
(Continued from previous page)    
reports (beginning in 2009) introduces potential variation from differences in the way the data were collected rather 
than actual changes in the marketplace.  However, in the absence of a continuous, unified data source, the 
Commission must rely on the available data, and our findings herein are consistent with the data.

Minority Commercial Broadcast Ownership in the United States 39 (2001) (NTIA 2001 Minority Ownership 
Report); see also 1999 Ownership Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 12924-43, paras. 42-91.  This was down from a previous 
peak of 38 minority-owned full-power television stations in 1995 and 1996/97.  NTIA 2001 Minority Ownership 
Report at 39.  The Commission has previously acknowledged that NTIA�s data collection methodology did �not 
insure a complete listing of all commercial radio and television stations owned by minorities� and the data did not 
include separate data on female ownership.  1998 Biennial Regulatory Review � Streamlining of Mass Media 
Applications, Rules, and Processes, Report and Order, 13 FCC Rcd 23056, 23096-97, para. 100 (1998).  However, 
these are the only data from that time period that are available for purposes of comparison and evaluation of claims 
that relaxation of the Local Television Ownership Rule reduced minority ownership.

(updated in footnote 20 of the 2014 323 Report to correct African American ownership total from 10 to 11).  As 
stated in footnote 16 of the 2014 323 Report, the number of minority-owned stations was temporarily increased by 
14 stations because an Asian individual indirectly held a majority interest in these stations while the entity that 
owned the stations was in bankruptcy.  This individual�s interest was terminated in November 2013, which 
eliminated the temporary increase.  Even discounting those 14 stations, there were 69 minority-owned stations in 
2013 based on the 323 data, which is more than double the number in 1998.
215 See, e.g., S. Derek Turner & Mark Cooper, Out of the Picture 2007:  Minority & Female TV Station Ownership 
in the United States (Oct. 2007), http://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/fp-legacy/otp2007.pdf (Turner/Cooper 
TV Study) (finding that minorities owned 43 commercial full-power television stations as of October 2007).  
216 The broadcast incentive auction will comprise of two separate but interdependent auctions�a reverse auction, 
which will determine the price at which broadcasters will voluntarily relinquish their spectrum usage rights; and a 
forward auction, which will determine the price companies are willing to pay for flexible use wireless licenses to 
deliver high-speed data services.  Television stations have a number of options by which they can participate:  they 
can choose to go off the air and relinquish their license entirely or relinquish their current channel to share a channel 
with another station, or they can move from their current channel to a channel in a different band.  The lynchpin 
joining the reverse and the forward auctions is the �repacking� process.  Repacking involves reassigning channels to 
the remaining television stations in order to create contiguous blocks of cleared spectrum suitable for flexible use.

frequency (UHF)-to-very-high frequency (VHF), or high-VHF-to-low-VHF bid, offers a significant and 
unprecedented opportunity for these owners to raise capital that may enable them to stay in the 
broadcasting business and strengthen their operations.�217  
80. The broadcast television incentive auction is ongoing and its implications�including, for 
example, which stations will relinquish their spectrum entirely and which will relinquish their current 
channel in order to share a channel with another station(s)�will not be known for some time.  
Broadcasters interested in participating in the reverse auction filed their applications in January 2016.218  
Entities interested in bidding in the forward auction on the spectrum made available through the reverse 
auction filed applications in February 2016.219 The clock round bidding for the reverse auction 
commenced on May 31, 2016, and concluded on June 29, 2016; the Commission announced August 16, 
2016, as the start date for the initial stage of the forward auction.220 Under statute, the identities of the 
broadcasters participating in the reverse auction are confidential.221 After the conclusion of the auction�
the date of which is unknown�the Commission will release a public notice announcing the reverse and 
forward auction winners, and identifying those television stations that will be reassigned to new channels 
(or �repacked�).  Reassigned stations will have up to 39 months after release of that public notice to 
complete the transition to their new channels, while winning bidders who will relinquish their spectrum 
entirely or move to share a channel with another station must do so within a specified number of months 
from receipt of their incentive payment.222
81. In light of these factors, and due to the fact that the incentive auction is a unique event 
without precedent, we cannot evaluate or predict the likely impacts of the auction at this time.  As noted 
above, we will soon commence our evaluation of the broadcast marketplace post-auction, and we expect 
that the Commission will address the implications of the incentive auction for the media ownership rules 
in the context of future quadrennial reviews.  Further, the court in Prometheus III indicated that �the 
Commission should consider how the ongoing broadcast incentive auction affects minority and female 
ownership.�223 Consistent with this direction and our previous requests for comment on this issue, we 
have evaluated the record and the status of the ongoing incentive auction, and it is our determination that 
it is too soon to assess the impact of the auction on minority and female ownership.

B. Local Radio Ownership Rule
1. Introduction
82. Based on the record in the 2010 and 2014 Quadrennial Review proceedings, we find that 
the current Local Radio Ownership Rule remains necessary in the public interest and should be retained 
without modification.224 We find that the rule remains necessary to promote competition and that the 
radio ownership limits promote viewpoint diversity �by ensuring a sufficient number of independent radio 
voices and by preserving a market structure that facilitates and encourages new entry into the local media 
market.�225 Similarly, we find that a competitive local radio market helps to promote localism, as a 
competitive marketplace tends to lead to the selection of programming that is responsive to the needs and 
interests of the local community.226  Also, we find that the Local Radio Ownership Rule is consistent with 
our goal of promoting minority and female ownership of broadcast television stations.  We find that these 
benefits outweigh any burdens that may result from retaining the rule without modification.  In addition, 
as discussed in greater detail below, we adopt certain clarifications and other actions proposed in the 
FNPRM that are designed to fulfill the intent of the revisions to the Local Radio Ownership Rule adopted 
in the 2002 Biennial Review Order.227
83. Accordingly, the Local Radio Ownership Rule will continue to permit the following:  An 
entity may own (1) up to eight commercial radio stations in radio markets with 45 or more radio stations, 
no more than five of which can be in the same service (AM or FM); (2) up to seven commercial radio 
stations in radio markets with 30-44 radio stations, no more than four of which can be in the same service 
(AM or FM); (3) up to six commercial radio stations in radio markets with 15-29 radio stations, no more 
than four of which can be in the same service (AM or FM); and (4) up to five commercial radio stations in 
radio markets with 14 or fewer radio stations, no more than three of which can be in the same service 
(AM or FM), provided that an entity may not own more than 50 percent of the stations in such a market, 
except that an entity may always own a single AM and single FM station combination.228
2. Background
84. The FNPRM proposed to retain the Local Radio Ownership Rule without modification.  
It sought comment on that proposal and on the application of the rule, including clarification of certain 
aspects adopted in the 2002 Biennial Review Order.229 Specifically, the FNPRM sought comment on the 
relevant market for review as well as on the proper approach for determining market size and setting 
numerical limits based on market size tiers.230 We also sought comment in the FNPRM on the retention 
of numerical limits in each market-sized tier, the retention of AM/FM subcaps, and the adoption of 
  
224 1996 Act � 202.

specific waiver criteria for the Local Radio Ownership Rule.231 Finally, we sought comment on the rule�s 
impact on minority and female ownership of local radio broadcast stations.232
85. Various public interest and public advocacy commenters supported the Commission�s 
decision to retain the existing rule.233 In addition, UCC et al. support tightening the local radio ownership 
limits and ending the grandfathering of existing combinations that exceed the rule�s limits, which they 
assert would better serve the Commission�s competition, diversity, and minority and female ownership 
goals.234
86. Broadcast commenters generally oppose the FNPRM�s proposal to retain the existing 
Local Radio Ownership Rule.235 These commenters argue that the rule should be eliminated or relaxed as 
a result of competition from non-broadcast audio sources, such as satellite radio, Internet-based audio 
services, and other mobile audio services.236 NAB also questions the efficacy of the Local Radio 
Ownership Rule with regard to promoting localism and diversity.237  
3. Discussion
87. Under Section 202(h), we consider whether the Local Radio Ownership Rule continues to 
be �necessary in the public interest as a result of competition.�  In determining whether the rule meets that 
standard, we consider whether the rule serves the public interest.  For the reasons discussed below, we

the Commission should examine and revise the interim contour-overlap methodology for non-Nielsen Audio Metro 
areas because the current interim methodology allows for too much consolidation in certain markets.  Curt R. 
Dunnam FNPRM Comments at 1-2 (FLAIM). We find no basis on which to revisit the interim contour-overlap 
methodology here.  As the Commission stated when it adopted the methodology, conducting case-by-case analysis 
would create significant regulatory uncertainty and adopting a �proxy� geographic market without proper 
consideration could produce unforeseeable distortions.  See 2002 Biennial Review Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 13729, 
para. 284 (adopting the interim contour-overlap methodology and noting that �its temporary use during the 
pendency of the rulemaking proceeding cannot be avoided� and that it is �well understood� and �would allow for 
the orderly processing of radio station applications�). We find that FLAIM has not provided adequate justification 
for us to depart from the Commission�s previous conclusion.  We also note that there is a separate open docket 
regarding this issue; FLAIM�s concerns are more properly addressed in that proceeding.  Id. at 13729, paras. 283-84.

rapidly over the last five years, which gives more consumers access to mobile/online audio services, such Pandora.  
Id. In addition, NAB states that companies such as Google, Apple, and Amazon now offer audio services, and the

to NAB�s assertions regarding competition from non-broadcast radio, the National Academy of Recording Arts and 
Sciences (NARAS) asserts that radio broadcasters enjoy a financial advantage over satellite and Internet radio 
because broadcast radio stations do not have to pay performance rights fees.  According to NARAS, this discrepancy 
distorts the market, and broadcasters should pay performance right fees in order to �level the playing field with other 
music services.�  National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences FNPRM Comments at 1-2.  We note that issues 
regarding performance rights fees are outside the scope of the Commission�s media ownership rules and will not be 
considered in this proceeding.

conclude that the current rule, without modification, meets that standard.  While we believe that the 
competition-based Local Radio Ownership Rule is consistent with our other policy goals and may 
promote such goals in various ways, we do not rely on these other goals as the basis for retaining the 
rule.238 Consistent with Commission precedent, upheld by the court in Prometheus II, we find that the 
Local Radio Ownership Rule continues to be necessary to protect competition, which provides a 
sufficient ground on which to retain the rule.239
88. Market.  We tentatively concluded in the FNPRM that the relevant product market for 
review of the Local Radio Ownership Rule is the radio listening market and that it is not appropriate to 
include non-broadcast audio sources in that market.  Public interest commenters generally support the 
Commission�s proposal to retain the rule along with the current relevant market definition.240
89. Other commenters oppose the Commission�s proposal to continue to exclude non-
broadcast audio sources from the relevant market.241  NAB states that online audio services are 
meaningful competitors to broadcast radio and that the Commission has recognized the impact online 
audio has on AM stations; NAB argues that this recognition should extend to FM stations as well.242  
NAB also disputes the Commission�s distinction of non-broadcast audio from local radio stations as 
national platforms because the national platforms still have a competitive impact on broadcast radio 
stations with regard to audience share and advertising revenue.243
90. We adopt our tentative conclusion that the radio listening market remains the relevant 
market for review of the Local Radio Ownership Rule and that it is not appropriate to expand the market 
to include non-broadcast audio.  When determining the appropriate market definition for the Local Radio 
Ownership Rule, we must determine whether alternate audio platforms provide consumers with a 
meaningful substitute for local broadcast radio stations.244 For purposes of our review, it is important to 
consider the nature of broadcast radio when determining whether an alternate source of audio 
programming provides a meaningful substitute for broadcast radio�the ability to access audio content 
alone is not sufficient to demonstrate substitution.  Broadcast radio stations provide free, over-the-air 
programming tailored to the needs of the stations� local markets.  In contrast, Internet radio requires either 
a fixed or mobile broadband Internet connection, and satellite radio requires a monthly subscription to 
access programming.  Neither of these sources is as universally and freely available as broadcast radio, 
and neither typically provides programming tailored to the needs and interests of specific local markets.           
91. As we noted in the FNPRM, despite the growing popularity of non-broadcast platforms 
such as satellite radio and Internet-delivered audio in the commercial audio industry, broadcast radio 
continues to dominate in its reach among listeners.245 For instance, the percentage of Americans age 12 or

older who listen to broadcast radio has remained constant at over 90 percent over the last decade.246  
Moreover, no commenter submitted data refuting the findings stated in the FNPRM, and recent data 
confirm that broadcast radio listenership remains essentially unchanged.247 In addition, the vast majority 
of Americans prefer to use broadcast radio as their in-car audio entertainment over new technology 
options.248 Lastly, we note that the growth of online radio listening likely includes audiences that are 
listening to streams of broadcast radio stations online instead of or in addition to listening over the air.249  
Ultimately, broadcast radio remains the most easily accessible and popular way for consumers to listen to 
audio programming, and the only one that focuses on the needs and interests of local markets.250
92. In addition, we disagree with NAB�s assertion regarding the lack of significance of non-
broadcast radio�s national platform.  The local character of broadcast radio is a significant aspect of the 
service that must be considered when determining whether alternate audio platforms provide a 
meaningful substitute.  The record fails to demonstrate that non-broadcast radio programmers make 
programming decisions to respond to competitive conditions in local markets.  As the Commission has 
stated previously, competition among local rivals most benefits consumers and serves the public 
interest.251  
93. We also disagree with NAB�s characterization that the Commission has recognized non-
broadcast radio programming as meaningful substitutes for broadcast radio simply by virtue of the 
Commission�s acknowledgment of the potential impact of alternate audio platforms on AM radio.252  
While the Commission has recognized that AM radio is susceptible to audience migration due to its 
technical shortcomings, recognition of this fact does not mean that non-broadcast audio alternatives are a 
meaningful substitute for AM radio, specifically, or broadcast radio, in general.  As discussed earlier, 
non-broadcast audio alternatives do not respond to competitive conditions in local markets and are not 
available to all consumers in a local market to the same extent as broadcast radio, which are critical 
considerations when determining substitutability.253

94. Ultimately, we find that the record demonstrates that alternative sources of audio 
programming are not currently meaningful substitutes for broadcast radio stations in local markets; 
therefore, we decline to depart from our tentative conclusion to exclude non-broadcast sources of audio 
programming from the relevant market for the purposes of the Local Radio Ownership Rule.254 We find 
that the Local Radio Ownership Rule should continue to focus on promoting competition among 
broadcast radio stations in local radio listening markets.  
95. Market Size Tiers.  We proposed in the FNPRM to retain the existing approach of setting 
numerical limits based on market size tiers and of determining the market size based on the number of 
commercial and noncommercial radio stations in the local market.  No commenters objected to the 
proposal to retain the market size tiers approach.  
96. As we said in the FNPRM, the Commission�s experience in applying the Local Radio 
Ownership Rule supports retention of the existing framework in order to promote competition.  The 
Commission consistently has found that setting numerical ownership limits based on market size tiers 
remains the most effective method for preventing the acquisition of market power in local radio 
markets.255 This bright-line approach helps to keep the limited available radio spectrum from becoming 
�locked up� in the hands of one or a few radio station owners.256 Furthermore, we believe that this 
approach benefits transaction participants by expediting the processing of assignment or transfer of 
control applications and by providing clear guidance on which transactions comply with the local radio 
ownership limits.

Table 1 & Table 2 (finding that, excluding satellite services, approximately 16.080 million Americans in the United 
States lack access to fixed 4 Mbps/1 Mbps and that the adoption rate for the U.S. as a whole for at least fixed 4 
Mbps/1 Mbps is approximately 58 percent).  When satellite services are considered, the number of Americans in the 
United States lacking access to fixed 4 Mbps/1 Mbps drops to approximately 1.376 million, though the adoption rate 
also drops to 56 percent.  Id.  While we do not take the position that advanced telecommunications/broadband 
deployment and adoption must be universal before we will consider Internet-delivered audio programming to be a 
competitor in the local radio listening market, we find that the current level of penetration and adoption of 
broadband service remains relevant when considering the extent to which this platform is a meaningful substitute for 
broadcast radio stations.  
254 Our proposal to limit the relevant market to broadcast radio stations in local radio listening markets is consistent 
with current Department of Justice (DOJ) precedent in evaluating proposed mergers involving broadcast radio 
stations.  See, e.g., Complaint, para. 9, United States v. Cumulus Media Inc., No. 1:11CV01619 (D.D.C. Sept. 8, 
2011) (�The relevant markets. . . are the sale of radio advertising time to advertisers targeting listeners in two

97. Two commenters propose alternative methodologies for determining market size tiers.  
Mid-West Family proposes that the Commission assign different values to stations of different classes 
when calculating how many stations an entity owns in a local market (e.g., Class C FM station = 1 
station; Class A FM station = .5 station).257 According to Mid-West Family, the disparity in coverage area 
related to station class puts owners of smaller stations at a competitive disadvantage because they cannot 
equal the audience reach of larger competitors.258 Alternatively, Mid-West Family proposes a case-by-
case analysis that would allow a station owner to acquire more stations than otherwise permitted under the 
rule in order to equalize the population coverage achieved by an in-market competitor.259 Connoisseur 
proposes that acquisitions involving stations in embedded markets�smaller radio markets that are located 
within the boundaries of a larger radio market (parent market)�should not be required to include stations 
owned in other embedded markets when demonstrating compliance with the ownership limits of a parent 
market.260
98. We decline to adopt Mid-West Family�s proposals.  First, we disagree with Mid-West 
Family�s contention that the Prometheus I decision mandates an adjustment to the rule�s current 
methodology in the way proposed by Mid-West Family.261  Second, as the Commission has said 
previously, adopting Mid-West Family�s approach would permit potentially significant consolidation in 
local radio markets, which would be inconsistent with the rationale for our retention of the existing 
numerical ownership limits discussed below.262 Specifically, Mid-West Family�s proposal to assign 
different values to stations of different classes does not account for the possibility of a relatively low 
power radio station potentially reaching a larger audience than a station with a larger service contour.  For 
example, a station with a small service contour that encompasses a densely populated area may have a

261 Mid-West Family contends that �[t]he Commission�s approach overlooks distinctions in the size, revenue, and 
audience share of radio stations,� and that this approach is inconsistent with the guidance provided by the court in 
Prometheus I to �consider marketplace realities in setting the ownership rules.�  Mid-West Family FNPRM
Comments at 3-4.  The language referred to by Mid-West Family from Prometheus I concerns one particular line of 
reasoning that was subsequently abandoned by the Commission in favor of a different set of rationales in the 2006 
Quadrennial Review Order, a shift in approach that the Prometheus II court noted and upheld.  See Prometheus II, 
652 F.3d at 462 (finding that �the FCC has demonstrated that the existing numerical limits are necessary in the 
public interest�); see also Prometheus I, 373 F.3d at 433-34 (finding that the Commission�s decision to retain the 
numerical limits was not supported by the theory that they ensure five equal-sized competitors in most markets).  
The Prometheus I language cited by Mid-West Family is therefore inapplicable to the current approach, which was 
first adopted  in the 2006 Quadrennial Review Order, and which was upheld by Prometheus II.  Id. Mid-West 
Family further argues that the Prometheus II decision is not controlling because no party raised the specific issue 
now identified by Mid-West Family, and thus the Prometheus II court did not address the issue in its decision.  Mid-

population reach similar to or greater than a station in the same market with a larger service contour that 
also covers more sparsely populated areas outside the main population center.  Such a scenario would not 
support counting the lower powered station as half of a higher powered station.  
99. Moreover, service contour (and the associated population coverage) is just one of many 
aspects of station operations that may impact the ability to compete in a local market.  For example, 
experienced management, programming quality, and on-air talent, among other factors, may all impact a 
station�s ability to compete.  Each station serves as a voice in its local market, and we are not inclined to 
discount the value of certain voices, particularly based on criteria that may have a limited impact on a 
station�s ability to compete.  For these reasons, we decline to change the methodology for determining 
market size tiers, as proposed by Mid-West Family.  
100. We also decline to adopt Mid-West Family�s proposal for a case-by-case analysis of 
population coverage.  As discussed above, we do not believe that population coverage alone is an 
appropriate basis on which to judge the competitiveness of a station (or cluster of stations) or the impact 
of these voices in the local market.  The existing rule already provides for economies of scale that help 
stations compete; we do not believe it is appropriate (or even possible) to revise the rule based on 
population coverage in an attempt to achieve a competitive equilibrium, which is effectively what Mid-
West Family seeks.  Moreover, the ability to seek a waiver of the ownership limits already provides 
parties with an opportunity to assert that special circumstances justify deviation from the rule in a 
particular case.  
101. We also decline to adopt Connoisseur�s proposal.  Under the current methodology for 
determining market size tiers, owners wishing to acquire a radio station in an embedded market must 
satisfy the numerical limits in both the embedded market and the overall parent market.  Connoisseur 
proposes that, where a parent market encompasses multiple embedded markets, the ownership analysis 
for an acquisition in one embedded market should not include stations owned in other embedded markets 
within the same parent market.263 Connoisseur argues that embedded markets within the same parent 
market may reach different populations and that stations within different embedded markets have little or 
no contour overlap.264 Connoisseur provides examples of embedded markets from the San Francisco, 
New York, and Washington, D.C., markets, with an analysis of only the New York embedded markets.265  
102. In the 2002 Biennial Review that adopted the Nielsen Audio Metro (formerly Arbitron 
Metro) methodology for determining radio markets, the Commission specifically declined to treat 
embedded markets differently.266 The Commission found that requiring proposed combinations to 
comply with the Local Radio Ownership Rule in each Nielsen Audio Metro implicated by the proposed 
combination (i.e., in both the embedded and parent markets) �comports with our general recognition that 
[Nielsen Audio�s] market definitions are the recognized industry standard.�267 We find that Connoisseur 
has not presented evidence of changes in the radio industry that would warrant an across-the-board 
departure from our longstanding reliance on Nielsen Audio�s market analysis as reported by BIA as the

basis for multiple ownership calculations for embedded and parent markets.  In these situations, a 
station�s above-the-line listing in the parent market (i.e., stations that are listed by BIA as �home� to that 
Metro) reflects a determination by Nielsen Audio and BIA that the station at issue competes in the parent 
market.268 For this reason, all embedded market stations that are listed as �home� to the parent market, 
like any other above-the-line stations, must be taken into account when demonstrating multiple ownership 
compliance in the parent market.269 In its comments, Connoisseur conflates the embedded and parent 
market analyses, suggesting that the parent market analysis erroneously introduces stations from one 
embedded market to another, which may have tenuous economic or listenership ties to the first.  This 
contention misses the point that, as a separate application of our multiple ownership rules, the parent 
market analysis necessarily includes all stations that compete in that market, whether or not they also 
compete in another embedded Metro market.  
103. That said, we recognize Connoisseur�s concerns that Nielsen Audio and BIA�s practice of 
designating all embedded market stations as �home� to the parent market�regardless of actual market 
share�could result in certain stations being counted for multiple ownership purposes in a market in 
which they do not actually compete.  Although we do not believe that the record justifies a blanket 
exception to the rule, we will entertain market-specific waiver requests under Section 1.3 demonstrating 
that the BIA listings in a parent market do not accurately reflect competition by embedded market stations 
and should thus not be �counted� for multiple ownership purposes.270 However, we decline to alter the 
methodology for determining market size tiers as proposed by Connoisseur.271
104. Numerical Limits.  We proposed in the FNPRM to retain the existing numerical limits in 
each market-sized tier and sought comment on any data that would support changing the existing limits.  
No commenter provided any such data, nor did any commenter propose specific numerical limits to 
replace the limits proposed in the FNPRM.  NAB argues that the Commission must justify the necessity 
of the numerical limits given the increasingly competitive audio marketplace.272
105. We conclude that the competitive conditions in the radio marketplace that supported the 
Commission�s decision to retain the existing numerical limits in the 2006 Quadrennial Review Order and 
to propose to retain the limits in the 2014 Quadrennial Review FNPRM remain largely unchanged.273 As 
demonstrated in the record, following the relaxation of the local radio ownership limits by Congress in the 
1996 Act, there was substantial consolidation of radio ownership both nationally and locally.274 In local 
markets, the largest firms continue to dominate in terms of audience and revenue share.275  
  
268 See id. at 13727, para. 279.
269 This principle is consistent with our treatment of stations whose communities of license are outside the 
geographic boundaries of a Metro but are listed by BIA as �home� to the Metro.  Such stations must comply with 
the multiple ownership limits in both the Metro market in which they are listed as �home� and the market in which 
their community of license is located, because they are considered to compete in both.  See id. at 13727-8, para. 280

106. We also conclude that the record in this proceeding does not reflect changes in the 
marketplace that warrant reconsideration of the Commission�s previous decision not to make the limits 
more restrictive.  We continue to believe that tightening the restrictions would disregard the previously 
identified benefits of consolidation in the radio industry and would be inconsistent with the guidance 
provided by Congress in the 1996 Act.276 Further, we continue to find that tightening the rule, absent 
grandfathering, would require divestitures that we believe would be disruptive to the radio industry and 
would upset the settled expectations of individual owners.277 No commenter provided information on 
whether the benefits derived from tightening the limits would outweigh these countervailing 
considerations.  For these reasons, and consistent with prior decisions, we conclude that tightening the 
limits would not be in the public interest.278  
107. Clarification of Application of Local Radio Ownership Rule.  In the FNPRM, we sought 
comment on clarifications to certain aspects of the Local Radio Ownership Rule adopted in the 2002 
Biennial Review Order.  Specifically, the FNPRM sought comment on (1) a clarification to the exception 
to the two-year waiting period for certain Nielsen Audio Metro changes; (2) an exemption from the Note 
4 grandfathering requirements for �intra-Metro� community of license changes; and (3) a redefinition of 
the Puerto Rico market.279  
108. In the 2002 Biennial Review Order, the Commission established safeguards to deter 
parties from attempting to manipulate Nielsen Audio Metro market definitions for purposes of 
circumventing the Local Radio Ownership Rule.  Specifically, the restrictions prohibit a party from 
receiving the benefit of a change in Nielsen Audio Metro boundaries or �home� market designation 
unless that change has been in place for at least two years (or unless the station�s community of license is 
within the Metro, in the case of a �home� designation change).280 In general, a licensee seeking to 
demonstrate multiple ownership compliance may rely upon the removal of a station from BIA�s list of 
�home� stations in a Metro, without a two-year waiting period, when the exclusion results from an FCC-
approved change in the community of license from a community that is within a Metro�s geographic 
boundaries to one that is outside the Metro.281 In the FNPRM, the Commission proposed to clarify that 
this exception applies only where the community of license change also involves the physical relocation 
of the station facilities to a site outside the relevant Nielsen Audio Metro market boundaries.282  
Otherwise, the licensee of a station currently located in a Nielsen Audio Metro market could use the 
exception to reduce the number of its stations listed as �home� to that Metro, without triggering the two-
year waiting period and without any change in physical coverage or market competition, merely by 
specifying a new community of license located outside the Metro.283 No commenter objected to this

clarification of the exception to the two-year waiting period.  Accordingly, we adopt this clarification as it 
will ensure that the local radio ownership limits cannot be manipulated based on Nielsen Audio market 
definitions.
109. Note 4 to Section 73.3555 of the Commission�s rules (Note 4) grandfathers existing 
station combinations that do not comply with the numerical ownership limits of Section 73.3555(a). 
However, we recognize that certain circumstances require applicants to come into compliance with the 
numerical ownership limits despite the fact that the relevant station may have been part of an existing 
grandfathered cluster.  One such circumstance is a community of license change, which occasionally can 
lead to difficulty when an applicant with a grandfathered cluster of stations seeks to move a station�s 
community of license outside the relevant Nielsen Audio Metro market.  Given that the Commission 
relies on the BIA database for information regarding Nielsen Audio Metro �home� designations, such an 
applicant cannot concurrently demonstrate compliance with the multiple ownership limits at the time of 
application filing, because the station proposing to change its community will continue to be listed by 
BIA as �home� to the Metro.284 To resolve this administrative issue, we adopt the proposal in the FNPRM
to allow a temporary waiver of the radio multiple ownership limits in this limited instance for three 
months from grant of the community of license modification application to allow BIA sufficient time to 
change the affected station�s �home� designation following a community of license relocation.  Grant of 
the application will be conditioned on coming into compliance with the applicable multiple ownership 
limits within three months.  In the event that the relevant station is still listed by BIA as �home� to the 
Metro at the end of this temporary waiver period, we will rescind grant of the application and re-specify 
the original community of license.285  
110. We also proposed to exempt �intra-Metro� community of license changes from the 
requirements of Note 4.  In 2006, the Commission introduced a streamlined procedure allowing an FM or 
AM broadcast licensee or permittee to change its community of license by filing a minor modification 
application.286 We have found that strict application of Note 4 has produced disproportionately harsh 
results from what is now otherwise a minor and routine application process.287 One commenter, Results 
Radio, suggests that the reasoning supporting the proposed exemption applies not only to community of 
license changes within the physical boundaries of the Metro market, but to any community of license 
change where the station remains designated as �home� to the Metro market.288 We agree that such an 
exemption would, in limited circumstances, provide equitable relief from the divestiture requirements of 
Note 4.  Moreover, we find that such intra-market community of license changes in most cases will have 
little or no impact on the concentration of ownership within the local market.  Accordingly, we adopt 
these exemptions to Note 4.289

111. Since 2003, the Commission has regularly waived the Nielsen Audio Metro market 
definition for Puerto Rico, which defines Puerto Rico as a single market, instead relying on a contour 
overlap analysis for proposed transactions.  The Commission has held that the unique characteristics of 
Puerto Rico present a compelling showing of special circumstances that warrant departing from the 
Nielsen Audio Metro as the presumptive definition of the local market.290 This practice is based on Puerto 
Rico�s extremely mountainous topography, large number of radio stations and station owners, and 
division into eight Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) as defined by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB), which demonstrate that Puerto Rico has more centers of economic activity than are 
accounted for by the single Puerto Rico Nielsen Audio Metro definition.291 In its comments filed in the 
2010 Quadrennial Review as well as in response to the FNPRM, the Arso Radio Corporation (Arso) 
renewed its longstanding request that the Commission redefine local radio markets for Puerto Rico.292  
Arso supports abandoning Nielsen Audio�s treatment of Puerto Rico as a single market and creating a 
new definition based on contour overlap.293 Arso states that it would also support any of the other 
approaches set forth in the FNPRM, such as relying on the eight MSAs or using the three Combined 
Statistical Areas defined by OMB.294
112. In previous waiver proceedings involving the Puerto Rico radio market, the Commission 
utilized the contour-overlap methodology that normally applies to defining markets in non-Nielsen Audio 
rated markets.295 Under the contour-overlap methodology, the relevant radio market is defined by the area 
encompassed by the mutually overlapping principal community contours of the stations proposed to be 
commonly owned.296 The Commission has determined previously that this methodology was appropriate 
to apply when examining the Puerto Rico radio market because of Puerto Rico�s unique characteristics as 
discussed above.297 Therefore, we conclude that adoption of the contour-overlap market definition will 
facilitate the most appropriate application of the Local Radio Ownership Rule in Puerto Rico, and we note 
that no commenters oppose this proposal.  Accordingly, we adopt the market definition based on contour 
overlap for Puerto Rico that we have applied consistently in previous waiver proceedings.
113. AM/FM Subcaps.  The AM/FM subcaps limit the number of stations from the same 
service�AM or FM�that an entity may own in a single market.  For example, in a market where an 
entity may own up to eight commercial radio stations, no more than five stations can be in the same 
service.  The FNPRM tentatively concluded that it was still appropriate to retain the existing AM/FM 
subcaps based on differences between AM and FM stations that continue to justify limits on the 
concentration of ownership in each service.298 Specifically, we found that the subcaps remained necessary 
to promote new entry and to account for the technological and marketplace differences between AM and 
FM stations and thereby promote competition.299 We sought comment on the impact of the digital radio

transition on the AM/FM subcaps, as well as issues regarding the aggregation of multiple AM stations to 
provide signal coverage in large geographic areas or in areas with mountainous terrain.  
114. Just as we have found that the public interest is served by retaining the existing numerical 
limits, we find it appropriate to retain the existing subcaps.  The subcaps, as originally adopted by 
Congress, were premised on the ownership limits adopted in the 1996 Act.300 As the Commission has 
stated previously, tightening one or both of the subcaps absent a corresponding change to the numerical 
ownership limits (or a tightening of one subcap absent a loosening of the other) would result in an internal 
inconsistency in the rule, as such a tightening would result in an entity not being permitted to own all the 
stations otherwise permitted under certain numerical tiers.301 We also find that loosening or abolishing 
the subcaps would create public interest harms by potentially permitting excessive consolidation of a 
particular service�an outcome the subcaps are designed to prevent�and reducing opportunities for new 
entry within local radio markets.302  
115. NAB opposes the proposal to retain the subcaps and argues that removing the subcaps 
would give licensees more flexibility in structuring ownership.303 NAB also states that the Commission 
should examine the necessity of the numerical subcap limits and explain why the numerical limits remain 
necessary given the increasingly competitive audio marketplace.304 Alternatively, NAB proposes 
removing the AM subcap to help address challenges faced by AM broadcasters.305
116. We are not persuaded by suggestions that eliminating the subcaps would result in public 
interest benefits sufficient to justify that action. While flexibility in ownership structuring may benefit 
existing licensees, such benefits may not extend to new entrants who potentially would see opportunities 
for radio ownership diminish through the increased concentration of ownership in a particular service that 
elimination of the subcaps would permit.  We also do not agree that eliminating or modifying the AM 
subcap would be an effective way to revitalize AM radio.306 NAB�s assertion that elimination of the

299 See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4414, para. 102 (noting that �AM signal propagation varies with the time of 
day�and many AM stations are required to cease operation at sunset�); Prometheus II, 652 F.3d at 462-63 (finding 
that the Commission provided an �adequate explanation� for retaining the AM/FM subcaps, which included 
specifically recognizing the significant technical and marketplace differences between AM and FM stations); 2006 
Quadrennial Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2080, para. 134 (noting �AM stations� lesser bandwidth, inferior audio 
signal, and smaller radio audiences due to such technical differences�); 2002 Biennial Review Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 
13733-34, para. 294.  As discussed below, we continue to find that, given their relative affordability, AM stations in 
general offer a particularly viable path to ownership for new entrants and represent significant radio voices in many 
of the top markets.  Moreover, we also continue to find that technological differences between FM and AM stations 
generally result in greater listenership and revenues for FM stations.  Recognizing these unique characteristics of 
each service, we continue to conclude that the AM and FM subcaps promote entry and competition in the local radio 
market and that there continue to be distinct reasons to separately limit the number of AM or FM stations in a 
market that any one entity can own.

may enjoy an advantage over stations in a different service��).

subcap would revitalize AM radio is unsupported, as NAB fails to explain how additional consolidation 
of AM stations will improve the ability of those stations to overcome existing technological and 
competitive challenges.
117. We continue to believe that broadcast radio, in general, remains the most likely avenue 
for new entry in the media marketplace�including entry by small businesses and entities seeking to serve 
niche audiences�as a result of radio�s ability to more easily reach certain demographic groups and the 
relative affordability of radio stations compared to other mass media.  As the Commission has stated 
previously, AM stations are generally the least expensive option for entry into the radio market, often by a 
significant margin, and therefore permit new entry for far less capital investment than is required to 
purchase an FM station.307 Nothing in the record of this proceeding indicates that this marketplace 
characteristic has changed.  Therefore, we conclude that the public interest remains best served by 
retaining the existing AM subcap, which limits concentration of AM station ownership and thereby 
promotes opportunities for new entry that further competition and viewpoint diversity.308  
118. Furthermore, despite the general technological limitations of AM stations, there continue 
to be many markets in which AM stations are �significant radio voices.�309 As noted in the FNPRM, 
throughout the 300 Nielsen Audio Metro markets at that time, there were 187 AM stations ranked in the 
top five in terms of all-day audience share.310 Also, AM stations are among the top revenue earners in 
some of the largest radio markets (e.g., New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles).311 We therefore find that, 
in addition to the general promotion of new entry across all markets described above, retention of the 
existing AM subcaps is also necessary to prevent a single station owner from acquiring excessive market 
power through concentration of ownership of AM stations in those markets in which AM stations are 
significant radio voices.
119. We also conclude that there continue to be technical and marketplace differences between 
AM and FM stations that justify retention of both the AM and FM subcaps in order to promote 
competition in local radio markets.  As the Commission has noted previously, FM stations enjoy unique 
advantages over AM stations, such as increased bandwidth, superior audio signal fidelity, and longer

308 See id. at 4413, para. 101 (finding that �broadcast radio, in general, continues to be a more likely avenue for entry 
in the media marketplace�including entry by small businesses and entities seeking to serve niche audiences�as a 
result of radio�s ability to more easily reach certain demographic groups and the relative affordability of radio 
stations compared to other mass media�); 2006 Quadrennial Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2079-80, para. 133; 
2002 Biennial Review Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 13739, para. 306.  In addition, we note that FCC Form 323 data for 
2011 and 2013 indicates that minority and female ownership of radio stations (and AM stations, in particular) 
exceeds that of television stations.  See generally 2014 323 Report, 29 FCC Rcd 7835; 2012 323 Report, 27 FCC 
Rcd 13814.  
309 See Prometheus II, 652 F.3d at 463 (finding that �AM stations are significant radio voices in many of the top 
markets, and that their further consolidation could injure the public interest, including harm to the goal of promoting 
minority and female ownership�); see also NPRM, 26 FCC Rcd at 17516, para. 76 (noting that commenters �assert 
that many of the top stations in in large and small markets are AM stations�).

stations continue to be �significant radio voices� in many markets.

hours of operation.312 These technological differences often, but not always, result in greater listenership 
and revenues for FM stations that justifies a limit on the concentration of FM station ownership, in 
particular.  Nothing in the record of this proceeding indicates that we should depart from the tentative 
conclusions in the FNPRM regarding the differences between AM and FM radio.  Therefore, we conclude 
that retaining the existing FM subcap continues to serve the public interest as well.  Accordingly, we 
retain both the AM and FM subcaps without modification.
120. We also find that the digital radio transition and the changes to the FM translator rules 
have not yet meaningfully ameliorated the general differences between AM and FM stations, such that the 
justifications described above have been rendered moot.313 Recent digital radio deployment data support 
previous findings that FM stations are actually increasing the technological divide through greater 
adoption rates of digital radio technology than AM stations.314 Also, the recent changes to the FM 
translator rules, �to allow AM stations to use currently authorized FM translator stations to retransmit 
their AM service within their AM stations� current coverage areas,� have not yet significantly impacted 
the technological and marketplace differences between AM and FM stations.315  While the change to the 
FM translator rule benefited many AM stations, more than half of all AM stations continue to operate 
without associated FM translators.316 We note that no commenter submitted objections or material in the 
record to refute our findings; however, we will continue to monitor the impact of the digital radio 
deployment and the FM translator rule change in future media ownership proceedings.    
121. Waiver Criteria.  We sought comment on whether to adopt specific waiver criteria for the 
Local Radio Ownership Rule and on our tentative decision declining to do so.317 Instead, we proposed to 
continue to rely on the general waiver standard under Section 1.3 of the Commission�s rules.
122. NAB opposes the Commission decision to continue to rely on the general waiver 
standard and supports adoption of a waiver standard that would permit common ownership when such 
consolidation increases the number of radio broadcast stations in operation (e.g., the waiver would allow a 
dark radio station to return to the air, prevent a financially struggling station from going off the air, or 
facilitate the construction of unbuilt radio stations).318
  
312 See, e.g., id. at 4413, para. 102; 2006 Quadrennial Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2080, para. 134; 2002 Biennial 
Review Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 13733-34, para. 294.
313 See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4414, paras. 103-04; Prometheus II, 652 F.3d at 463 (�Although the digital 
transition may ultimately have a significant effect on the technological and economic advantages of FM stations, it 
has not yet done so.  Thus, the FCC was justified in declining to rely on it in evaluating the rule.�).
314 See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4414, para. 103 n.269.  The trends noted in the FNPRM have continued.  Based on 
staff analysis of Consolidated Database System (CDBS) license data as of October 30, 2015, and broadcast station 
totals as of September 30, 2015, of the 10,778 licensed FM stations (commercial and educational), 1,841 have 
notified the Commission that they have commenced digital operations (approximately 17.1 percent), while only 239 
of the 4,692 licensed AM stations have filed such notifications (approximately 5.1 percent).  See Broadcast Station 
Totals as of September 30, 2015, News Release (MB Oct. 9, 2015), http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/

123. We decline to adopt specific waiver criteria for the Local Radio Ownership Rule and will 
continue to rely on the general waiver standard.  NAB has not provided sufficient information on which to 
evaluate why a specific waiver standard would be necessary.  Indeed, we find that the considerations in 
NAB�s proposal can be advanced adequately in the context of a general waiver request under Section 1.3 
of the Commission�s rules.319 Therefore, we conclude that adoption of a specific waiver standard is not 
appropriate at this time.
124. Minority and Female Ownership.  The FNPRM tentatively concluded that the proposed 
Local Radio Ownership Rule was consistent with the Commission�s goal to promote minority and female 
ownership.320 The FNPRM noted that part of the rationale for retaining the AM/FM subcaps was to 
promote new entry, particularly in the AM band, which has historically provided low-cost ownership 
opportunities for new entrants, including women and minorities.321 The FNPRM also tentatively declined 
to tighten the ownership limits in order to promote minority and female ownership, as some commenters 
had recommended, and found that retention of the existing ownership limits addressed the concerns of 
those commenters who believed that additional consolidation would harm minority and female 
ownership.322 UCC et al. support the Commission�s proposal to retain the existing Local Radio 
Ownership Rule; however, they assert that the Commission must do even more to increase levels of 
minority and female ownership, including tightening the numerical limits or ending the exemption for 
grandfathered combinations.323  
125. We affirm our tentative conclusion that the current rule remains consistent with the 
Commission�s goal to promote minority and female ownership of broadcast radio stations.324 While we 
retain the existing Local Radio Ownership Rule for the specific reasons stated above, we find that 
retaining the existing rule nevertheless promotes opportunities for diverse ownership in local radio 
ownership.  This competition-based rule indirectly advances our diversity goal by helping to ensure the 
presence of independently owned broadcast radio stations in the local market, thereby increasing the 
likelihood of a variety of viewpoints and preserving ownership opportunities for new entrants.  We have 
also retained the AM/FM subcaps, in part, to help promote new entry�as noted, the AM band in 
particular has historically provided lower-cost ownership opportunities for new entrants.  
126. Consistent with our analysis of the local television ownership rule above, however, we 
find the claim that tightening the Local Radio Ownership Rule would promote increased opportunities for 
minority and female ownership to be speculative and unsupported by existing ownership data.325 Notably, 
NTIA ownership data from 1995�the year before the local radio ownership limits were relaxed and set to 
the existing levels�identified 312 minority owned radio stations (racial and ethnic minorities for both

325 Combining older data with more recent data from FCC Form 323 biennial ownership reports (beginning in 2009) 
introduces potential variation based on differences in the way the data were collected rather than actual changes in

available data, and our findings herein are consistent with the data.

AM and FM stations).326 The data demonstrate lower overall levels in 1996/97 (284 stations) and 1998 
(305 stations); however, the total grew to 426 stations in 1999/2000, though NTIA attributes 
approximately half the growth between 1999 and 1999/2000 to improved methodology for identifying 
minority owned stations.327 The Commission�s Form 323 ownership data demonstrate that minority 
ownership has grown�indeed, more than doubled�since the rule was relaxed:  644 stations in 2009; 756 
stations in 2011; and 768 stations in 2013.328 Data provided by Free Press also show an increase in 
minority ownership after the Local Radio Ownership Rule was relaxed in 1996.329 No data in the record 
support a contention that tightening the local radio ownership limits would promote ownership 
opportunities for minorities and women.  
127. In addition, we do not believe that Media Ownership Study 7, which considers the 
relationship between ownership structure and the provision of radio programming targeted to African-
American and Hispanic audiences, supports the contention that tightening the local radio ownership limits 
would promote minority and female ownership.  While the data suggest that there is a positive 
relationship between minority ownership of radio stations and the total amount of minority-targeted radio 
programming available in a market, the potential impact of tightening the ownership limits on minority 
ownership was not part of the study design, nor something that can be reasonably inferred from the data.  
128. While the NTIA and Form 323 data discussed above show an increase in ownership 
diversity since the local radio ownership limits were relaxed in 1996, which we have noted, we recognize 
some limits to their probative value.  It is important to note that there is nothing in these data or any other 
evidence in the record that would permit us to infer causation; therefore, we decline to loosen the existing 
ownership limits on the basis of any trend reflected in the data.  In addition, as discussed above, we 
decline to loosen the current limits, which place limits on consolidation, because we continue to find that 
the existing rule remains necessary to promote competition in local radio markets.  Consistent with this 
conclusion, we remain mindful of the potential impact of consolidation in the radio industry on ownership 
opportunities for new entrants, including small businesses, and minority- and women-owned businesses, 
and we will continue to consider the implications in the context of future quadrennial reviews.  
C. Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule
1. Introduction
129. The Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership (NBCO) Rule prohibits common ownership 
of a daily newspaper and a full-power broadcast station (AM, FM, or TV) if the station�s service contour 
encompasses the newspaper�s community of publication.330 In analyzing the NBCO Rule under Section 
  
326 NTIA 2001 Minority Ownership Report at 38.  As noted in the discussion of the Local Television Ownership 
Rule, the Commission has previously acknowledged that NTIA�s data collection methodology did �not insure a 
complete listing of all commercial radio and television stations owned by minorities� and the data did not include 
separate data on female ownership.  However, these are the only data from that time period that are available for 
purposes of comparison and evaluation of claims that tightening the local radio ownership limits would promote

202(h), our focus is on the rule�s primary purpose�to promote viewpoint diversity at the local level.  As 
the Commission noted in adopting the NBCO Rule, �[i]f our democratic society is to function, nothing 
can be more important than insuring that there is a free flow of information from as many divergent 
sources as possible.�331 Broadcast stations and daily newspapers remain the predominant sources of the 
viewpoint diversity that the NBCO Rule is designed to protect.  The proliferation of (primarily national) 
content available from cable and satellite programming networks and from online sources has not altered 
the enduring reality that traditional media outlets are the principal sources of essential local news and 
information.  The rapid and ongoing changes to the overall media marketplace do not negate the rule�s 
basic premise that the divergence of viewpoints between a cross-owned newspaper and broadcast station 
�cannot be expected to be the same as if they were antagonistically run.�332 Some commenters argue that 
eliminating the NBCO Rule would benefit localism and competition.  Because the purpose of the NBCO 
Rule hinges on viewpoint diversity, we find these arguments to be unpersuasive.
130. After careful consideration of the record, we conclude that regulation of 
newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership within a local market remains necessary to protect and promote 
viewpoint diversity.  We continue to find, however, that an absolute ban on newspaper/broadcast cross-
ownership is overly broad.333 Accordingly, and consistent with the Commission�s approach in the 2006 
proceeding, the rule we adopt today generally prohibits common ownership of a broadcast station and 
daily newspaper in the same local market but provides for a modest loosening of the previous ban on 
cross-ownership consistent with our view that an absolute ban may be overly restrictive in some cases.  
We find that the benefits of the revised rule, outlined below, outweigh any burdens that may result from 
adopting the rule.   
131. First, although we maintain the rule�s general prohibition, we modify its geographic 
scope to update its analog parameters and to reflect more accurately the markets that newspapers and 
broadcasters actually serve.  Specifically, in light of the fact that the transition to digital television service 
has rendered obsolete the rule�s reliance on an analog contour to determine when the 
newspaper/television cross-ownership restriction is triggered, we define the geographic scope of that 
restriction using a television station�s digital principal community contour (PCC) as defined in Section 
73.625 of the Commission�s rules.334 More importantly, in order to focus the application of the rule more 
precisely on the areas served by broadcast stations and newspapers, we revise the trigger of the NBCO 
Rule to consider both the contour of the television or radio station involved, and whether the station and 
the newspaper are located in the same Nielsen DMA or Audio Market (if any).  As discussed further 
below, we believe this will narrow the application of the rule to those situations where the newspaper and 
broadcast station truly serve the same local audience.    
132. Second, in recognition of the fact that a proposed merger involving a failed or failing 
entity does not present a significant risk to viewpoint diversity, we adopt an explicit exception to the 
NBCO Rule for proposed mergers involving a failed or failing broadcast station or newspaper.   
133. Third, we will consider waivers of the NBCO Rule on a case-by-case basis and grant 
relief from the rule if the applicants can show that the proposed merger will not unduly harm viewpoint 
diversity in the market.  In recognizing that a complete ban was potentially overly broad, the Commission

in the 2006 Quadrennial Review Order adopted a presumptive waiver standard that automatically favored 
some proposed mergers, but disfavored mergers in the vast majority of markets.  We continue to believe 
that adopting a waiver standard specifically in the context of the NBCO Rule will provide appropriate 
relief from the complete ban; however we reject a presumptive waiver approach and will instead adopt a 
pure case-by-case approach.  Such an approach will allow the Commission to consider the individual 
merits of a proposed merger, taking into consideration the totality of the circumstances, in a manner that 
is better suited to evaluating the potential effects of a proposed merger on viewpoint diversity in the local 
market.  This approach will enable the Commission to focus its attention immediately on the evidence 
that is most relevant for each waiver request.  In addition, we will allow for more timely and effective 
public participation in a waiver proceeding by requiring that, if the owner of a broadcast station seeks to 
acquire a newspaper under conditions that trigger the NBCO Rule, it must file a waiver request prior to 
consummating the acquisition, rather than at the time of its license renewal as previously permitted.
134. Finally, while we adopt this rule in order to help promote viewpoint diversity, we find 
that the rule we adopt is consistent with our goal of promoting minority and female ownership.  
2. Background 
135. In adopting the original NBCO Rule, the Commission�s paramount goal was to promote 
and preserve a diversity of viewpoints at the local level, although the Commission�s competition goal also 
factored into the decision.335 The Commission observed that �it is essential to a democracy that its 
electorate be informed and have access to divergent viewpoints on controversial issues.�336 The Supreme 
Court upheld the NBCO Rule and found that the Commission acted reasonably by relying on separation 
of ownership as a means to promote viewpoint diversity.337 It approved the Commission�s approach of 
measuring viewpoint diversity by looking at media outlets that disseminate local news, rather than those 
that primarily offer regional and national news.338  
136. Although the Commission twice attempted to modify the NBCO Rule, it has never 
wavered from its goal of promoting viewpoint diversity.  In the 2002 Biennial Review Order, the 
Commission concluded that the NBCO Rule was not necessary to promote its goals of localism or 
competition, and might even hinder its localism goal.339 Nonetheless, to protect viewpoint diversity, the 
Commission continued to restrict cross-ownership by replacing the NBCO Rule with a set of cross-media 
limits that were designed to ensure that a single entity could not �dominate public debate� in a local 
media market.340 The cross-media limits, which applied a more relaxed standard than the NBCO 
restriction, reflected the Commission�s conclusion that a cross-ownership ban may not be appropriate �in 
all communities and in all circumstances.�341 The Third Circuit upheld the Commission�s decision to

retain limits on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership as necessary to protect viewpoint diversity.342 The 
court, however, remanded the cross-media limits after finding that the Commission failed to support the 
new limits with a reasoned analysis.343 As a result of the remand, the prior cross-ownership ban remained
in effect.
137. In the 2006 Quadrennial Review Order, the Commission affirmed its findings that 
newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership restrictions protect viewpoint diversity.344 The Commission 
rejected the remanded cross-media limits and relied on the cross-ownership ban in the existing NBCO 
Rule as the starting point for its oversight of newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership.345 However, 
consistent with its previous finding that a complete ban may be overly restrictive in certain circumstances, 
the Commission adopted a waiver approach that set forth circumstances under which it would view a 
waiver request favorably.346 Specifically, the Commission decided to award a favorable presumption to 
waiver requests for proposed combinations in the 20 largest Nielsen DMAs and, in the case of a proposed 
newspaper/television combination, when the television station was not ranked among the DMA�s top four 
television stations and when eight major media voices would remain in the market.347  
138. Following the adoption of the 2006 Quadrennial Review Order, the Third Circuit vacated 
and remanded the revised NBCO Rule on procedural grounds, namely that the Commission did not 
provide adequate prior public notice of its proposed rule as required by the Administrative Procedure 
Act.348 The court did not address the Commission�s substantive modifications to the rule.349 Thus, 
notwithstanding the Commission�s action in the 2006 quadrennial proceeding, the original NBCO Rule is 
currently in effect.  
139. In the FNPRM, consistent with the NPRM, we sought comment on our tentative 
conclusion that some restriction on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership remains necessary to protect 
and promote viewpoint diversity in local markets.350 Given the Commission�s findings in previous 
reviews that application of the NBCO Rule may not be necessary in every circumstance, we sought

merger was inconsistent with the public interest.  Waiver applicants needed to overcome the �high hurdle� of a 
negative presumption with �clear and convincing evidence� that the proposed combination would increase diversity 
and competition in the relevant market.  However, a negative presumption could be reversed when either:  (1) the 
newspaper or broadcast outlet was failed or failing; or (2) the proposed combination would result in a significant 
new source of local news in the market.  2006 Quadrennial Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2047-49, paras. 65-68.  
Under the 2006 Rule, all waiver requests, regardless of the presumption that attached, were subject to a four-factor 
test.  Waiver applicants were required to show:  (1) that the combined entity would increase significantly the amount 
of local news in the market; (2) that the newspaper and broadcast outlets each would continue to employ its own 
staff and exercise its own independent news judgment; (3) the level of concentration in the Nielsen DMA; and 
(4) the financial condition of the newspaper or broadcast station, and if the newspaper or broadcast station was in 
financial distress, the proposed owner�s commitment to invest significantly in newsroom operations.  2006

comment in the FNPRM on whether we might consider relief without posing a threat to viewpoint 
diversity, and if so, when and how such relief should be considered.351 First, we asked whether the
prohibition on newspaper/radio combinations could be lifted without harming viewpoint diversity.352  
Second, although we proposed to maintain the newspaper/television cross-ownership restriction in all 
markets, we sought comment on how to approach requests for waiver of the restriction.353 We asked 
whether we should consider waiver requests on a purely case-by-case basis, assessing each request 
individually and considering the totality of the circumstances each proposed transaction presented.354  
Further, we sought comment on an alternative approach that would include presumptions to favor or 
disfavor waivers in accordance with certain prescribed guidelines.355  
140. In addition, in recognition of the transition to digital television, we proposed that any 
newspaper/television cross-ownership restriction be modified to replace the obsolete analog Grade A 
contour.  We proposed to prohibit common ownership of a full-power television station and a daily 
newspaper when:  (1) the television station�s community of license and the newspaper�s community of 
publication are in the same Nielsen DMA, and (2) the PCC of the television station, as defined in Section 
73.625 of the Commission�s rules, encompasses the entire community in which the newspaper is 
published.356 Further, we proposed to adopt an exception for merger applicants that demonstrate that 
either the station or the newspaper has failed or is failing.357 Finally, we tentatively concluded that the

FCC Rcd at 17526, para. 102; FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4445, para. 168 n.482.

355 Id. at 4420, 4441, paras. 118, 156.  Specifically, as an alternative to a pure case-by-case approach to waiver 
requests, the FNPRM discussed the possibility of a presumptive waiver standard, which would hold that an applicant 
would be entitled to a favorable presumption in the case of a newspaper/television combination consisting of one 
daily newspaper and one full-power television station provided that the combination was located in a top-20 Nielsen 
DMA and:  (1) the television station was not ranked among the top-four television stations in the DMA, based on the 
most recent all-day (9 a.m.�midnight) audience share, as measured by Nielsen or by any comparable professional, 
accepted audience ratings service, and (2) at least eight independently owned and operating major media voices 
would remain in the DMA.  Major media voices would include full-power television broadcast stations and any 
newspapers that are published at least four days a week within the DMA in the dominant language of the market and 
have a circulation exceeding five percent of the households in the DMA.  In all other cases and in any DMA below 
the top-20 there would be a presumption that granting a waiver to permit a newspaper/television combination would 
be inconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.  A party seeking to overcome a presumption 
would carry the burden of proof that the proposed combination would or would not unduly harm viewpoint diversity 
within the DMA.  We sought comment on all aspects of this approach.  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4445-52, paras.

NBCO Rule does not have a significant impact on minority and female broadcast ownership, and we 
expressed our belief that the potential revisions we put forth for comment would be unlikely to have a 
disproportionate effect on either minority or female owners. 
3. Discussion
a. Policy Goals
141. Commenters continue to debate the Commission�s public interest rationale for the NBCO 
Rule, offering differing views regarding the rule�s effects on the Commission�s policy goals of diversity, 
localism, and competition.  Positions range from an argument that newspaper/broadcast combinations 
should be subject only to antitrust rules358 to an argument that all three public policy goals justify the rule 
because the goals are �inextricably linked.�359
142. Viewpoint diversity.  The record before us reaffirms our view that the NBCO Rule 
remains necessary to promote diversity, specifically viewpoint diversity.360 The FNPRM commenters that 
oppose our position do not present evidence persuading us to alter our tentative conclusion in the FNPRM
that newspapers and broadcast television stations, and their affiliated websites, continue to be the 
predominant providers of local news and information upon which consumers rely.361 In addition, as 
discussed below, the record demonstrates that broadcast radio stations continue to be an important source 
of viewpoint diversity in local markets.  For the most part, opponents of the rule reiterate the two 
principal arguments put forth by commenters to the initial NPRM, namely that:  (1) �ownership does not 
necessarily influence viewpoint� and (2) �an array of diverse viewpoints is widely available from an 
abundance of outlets, particularly via the Internet.�362 We addressed these arguments extensively in the 
FNPRM, and we do not find them any more persuasive after reviewing the FNPRM comments.363
143. With regard to the first argument, NAB and Newspaper Association of America (NAA) 
contend that the Commission provides no evidence that commonly owned newspapers and broadcast 
stations speak with a single editorial voice.364 NAA claims that commonly owned newspapers and 
broadcast stations employ �independent editors and news directors who control the tone and direction of

the news content,� even though they may share administrative and newsgathering resources.365 NAB 
proffers a list of studies that it claims show that the ideological predispositions of consumers, not 
ownership, drive viewpoint diversity.366
144. In the FNPRM, we acknowledged that NPRM commenters provided examples of 
instances when cross-owned properties diverged in viewpoint.367 We noted, however, that, although 
similar examples were provided during the Commission�s 2002 and 2006 reviews, the Commission 
continued to restrict newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership given that an owner has the opportunity, 
ability, and right to influence the editorial process of media outlets it owns, regardless of the degree to 
which it exercises that power.368 The Third Circuit affirmed the Commission�s reasoning that the 
possibility of a connection between ownership and viewpoint is not disproved by evidence that a 
connection is not always present.369 Moreover, the Commission has noted previously the existence of 
ample evidence pointing in the other direction, namely that ownership can affect viewpoint.370 In any 
event, our goal is to maximize the number of distinct voices in a market, which we believe is achieved 
more effectively by relying on separate ownership rather than on a hope or expectation that owners of 
cross-owned properties will maintain a distance from the editorial process.  Our concern is not alleviated 
by NAB�s argument that consumers� ideological preferences have a greater influence on editorial slant 
than ownership does.371 Indeed, we believe that such influence only increases the importance of ensuring 
that a multiplicity of voices are available to consumers.
145. With regard to the second argument, opponents of the rule contend that today�s access to 
a multitude of voices from numerous sources compels repeal of the rule,372 and they describe how the 
media environment has changed since the adoption of the NBCO Rule.373 Bonneville/Scranton notes that, 
in addition to the rise of cable and satellite television and the Internet, the number of broadcast facilities 
has nearly tripled since the rule�s adoption.374 NAA argues that the Commission�s tentative conclusion 
that the Internet has not eliminated the need for cross-ownership restrictions contradicts the Third

Circuit�s conclusion in 2004 that cable and the Internet supplement the viewpoint diversity provided by 
broadcasters and newspapers.375 Cox states that it �has watched the diversity of news and entertainment 
sources explode, as its markets have been flooded with new entrants.�376 Morris contends that the 
Commission�s statutory obligations require it to look beyond traditional media and consider the �full 
panoply� of additional sources available as a result of the digital revolution.377 Similarly, NAB claims the 
Commission is acting arbitrarily and capriciously by focusing on only two types of traditional media as 
the �true� sources of viewpoint diversity.378
146. In particular, several commenters argue that the Internet renders the NBCO Rule 
obsolete.  They point to various ways in which the Internet has made it possible to access news and 
information anywhere at any time.379 NAB argues that the ability of consumers to access local 
information sources directly through the Internet undermines the Commission�s view that traditional news 
outlets continue to dominate local news production and consumption.380 Delmarva et al. cites studies 
claiming that Americans access digital and online sources more often than radio or newspapers for daily 
news and that social media surpasses newspapers and equals television as a primary source of daily news

concluded that a cross-ownership restriction remains necessary, despite the increase in media outlets.384  
Supporters of the rule agreed with us that traditional news providers, and their affiliated websites, 
continue to be the most relied-upon sources of local news and information.385 In the FNPRM, we pointed 
to evidence suggesting that, despite the Internet�s increased role in news distribution, traditional news 
providers are still critical to ensuring viewpoint diversity at the local level.386 The record showed that 
independent online sources �currently do not provide a substitute for the original reporting by 
professional journalists associated with traditional local media.�387
148. After reviewing the FNPRM comments, which raise substantially the same points that we 
addressed in the FNPRM, our position is unchanged.  Several FNPRM commenters reiterate that our 
focus on traditional media is too narrow because other media outlets contribute to viewpoint diversity.  
Evidence shows, however, that the contributions of cable, satellite, and Internet sources serve as a 
supplement, but not as a substitute, for newspapers and broadcasters providing local news and 
information.388 The news and information provided by cable and satellite networks generally targets a 
wide geographic audience, and the record demonstrates that local news and information available online 
usually originates from traditional media outlets.389 We affirm our earlier finding that local, hyperlocal, 
and niche websites generally do not fill the role of local television stations or daily newspapers.390

news present sufficient competition to local newspapers in Orange County and Riverside County in Southern 
California.  The judge concluded that, as creators of local content, �local newspapers continue to serve a unique 
function in the marketplace� and are not �reasonably interchangeable� with online sources of news.  He was �not 
convinced . . . that the [I]nternet renders geography and distinctions between kinds of news sources obsolete.�

from acquiring the assets of a bankrupt publisher of two local newspapers in Southern California).  
389 As discussed in the NPRM and FNPRM, considerable evidence shows that most online sources of local news are 
affiliated with newspapers or broadcast stations or contain content that originates from those traditional sources.  See

local news reached a record high of 1,053; the amount of local news on television reached a record high, 
with an average amount of weekday news of 5.5 hours; the percentage of television stations adding a 
newscast increased more than seven points from 2014; and 33.2 percent of television news directors 
expect to air more news in 2016.391 These findings are not surprising given evidence cited in the FNPRM
that local television remains Americans� most popular source of local news and information.392 Local 
television continues to dominate despite the increasing use of social media as a source of news.393  
Moreover, the social media platforms that consumers turn to for news, such as Facebook, Twitter, and 
Google, generally aggregate news stories from other sources and those sources do not focus necessarily 
on local news.394
149. Even opponents of the NBCO Rule recognize the continuing role of newspapers and 
broadcasters as the primary producers of original reporting centered on local news.395 In addition, 
although Bonneville/Scranton observes that broadcast facilities in the United States have nearly tripled 
since the Commission originally contemplated the NBCO Rule,396 the record does not reflect a significant 
increase in facilities since our most recent ownership reviews in which the Commission determined that 
continuing regulation of newspaper/broadcast combinations was necessary to promote and protect 
viewpoint diversity.397 Furthermore, Bonneville/Scranton�s observation regarding a nationwide increase 
in broadcast facilities does not provide a basis for lifting the restriction, which is local in scope, because 
the increase may be spread unevenly across individual markets.
150. We conclude that the NBCO Rule should continue to apply to newspaper/radio cross-
ownership.  We find that the newspaper/radio cross-ownership restriction serves the public interest 
because the record before us shows that radio stations contribute in meaningful ways to viewpoint 
diversity within their communities.  We are persuaded that radio adds an important voice in many local 
communities such that lifting the restriction could harm viewpoint diversity.  Although the Commission 
tentatively concluded earlier in this proceeding that radio stations are not the primary outlets that 
contribute to viewpoint diversity in local markets and that consumers rely predominantly on other sources 
for local news and information,398 we find that radio�s role in promoting viewpoint diversity is significant 
enough to warrant retention of the restriction.  Therefore, for the reasons explained in more detail below, 
we decline to eliminate the restriction399 or to adopt a presumptive waiver standard, such as the one 
proposed in the NPRM, favoring newspaper/radio mergers in the top 20 DMAs.400

151. Supporters of the newspaper/radio cross-ownership restriction urge the Commission not 
to discount radio�s contributions to viewpoint diversity.  UCC et al. argue that the legal standard in 
Section 202(h) does not require a showing that repeal of the restriction would harm viewpoint diversity, 
and they assert that it is sufficient for the Commission to find that the restriction is useful in serving the 
public interest.401 To that end, UCC et al. cite studies finding that 33 percent of Americans listened to 
news radio �yesterday,� a higher percentage than those that read a newspaper the day before, and that 51 
percent of people obtain local news on the radio at least once a week.402 In addition, UCC et al. point to a 
study by the Pew Research Center showing that over 4,000 radio stations identify themselves as 
�news/talk/information� or �talk/personality� and that these formats are second in popularity to country 
music formats and enjoy the longest listening times among their audiences.403 In addition, UCC et al. and 
NHMC challenge the view that music format stations do not contribute to viewpoint diversity.404 UCC et 
al. provide examples of radio stations that would not be categorized as news stations but that nonetheless 
air programs addressing issues of local concern, such as HIV/AIDS awareness and domestic violence.405  
UCC et al. note also that the Pew study observed that radio listeners of music or sports programs likely 
are exposed to hourly headline newscasts.406
152. UCC et al. and National Hispanic Media Coalition (NHMC) claim further that radio 
stations play an important role for underserved communities.  NHMC asserts that the Latino community, 
in particular, relies on radio as a source of news and information to a greater degree than the general
population.407 It provides data showing that radio listenership is higher among Latinos than other ethnic 
groups and that 56 percent of Latinos obtain news from radio on a typical weekday.408 NHMC argues that 
Latino-owned radio stations, both news/talk stations and music format stations, provide news and 
information of interest to their local communities, and it uses immigration issues as a prime example.409

Similarly, UCC et al. objects to the Commission�s statement that the record does not suggest that 
minority- and female-owned stations contribute more significantly to viewpoint diversity than other radio 
stations.410 In support, it cites a Pew study finding that the 2008 presidential candidates used black talk 
radio to reach the African-American community.411 It points to a finding that the more often that media 
outlets target a minority group, the more likely that group is to vote.412 It contends further that the racial 
identity of the station owner is linked to the voter participation of its listeners.413  
153. Opponents of the newspaper/radio cross-ownership restriction agree with the 
Commission�s tentative conclusion that radio stations are not the primary outlets that contribute to local 
viewpoint diversity.414 Morris and Stephens Capital Partners LLC (SCP) assert that radio�s lesser role in 
promoting viewpoint diversity is reflected in the history of the NBCO Rule and the Commission�s past 
findings to that effect.415 Morris argues further that the relevant question is not whether radio stations 
provide any local news, but whether their contributions to viewpoint diversity are significant enough to 
justify the restriction.416  Bonneville/Scranton claims that radio stations generally engage in little local 
news production.417 In addition, Morris argues that studies, including the studies cited by UCC et al. and 
NHMC, show that the reliance on radio for local news is decreasing and is considerably less than UCC et 
al. and NHMC suggest.418 Bonneville/Scranton claims that supporters of the rule �muddy the

music and entertainment.419 It argues that the news contributions of music-format radio stations do not 
equate to those of local daily newspapers.420  NAA argues that, although music radio personalities provide 
services vital to the community, they serve a different function than a newspaper�s local reporter and are 
not a substitute source for the original local news offered by newspapers.421
154. After careful consideration of the full record and consistent with our initial proposal in 
the NPRM to continue to include newspaper/radio restrictions in the NBCO Rule,422 we will retain the 
newspaper/radio cross-ownership restriction in order to protect and promote viewpoint diversity in local 
markets.  Although we continue to find that, in general, newspapers and television stations are the main 
sources that consumers turn to for local news and information, we conclude that radio contributes 
sufficiently to viewpoint diversity to warrant retention of the newspaper/radio cross-ownership 
restriction.423 As discussed in the FNPRM, this conclusion is consistent with the Commission�s 
longstanding position that newspaper/radio combinations should be prohibited even though radio 
generally plays a lesser role in contributing to viewpoint diversity.424 A lesser role does not mean that 
radio plays no role.  The record shows that broadcast radio stations produce a meaningful amount of local 
news and information content that is relied on by a significant portion of the population and, therefore, 
provide significant contributions to viewpoint diversity.  
155. With over 90 percent of Americans listening to radio on a weekly basis, radio�s potential 
for influencing viewpoint is great.425 Moreover, recent evidence suggests that radio stations air a 
substantial amount of local news programming.  For example, RTDNA�s annual national survey of 
newsrooms showed that radio stations in major markets air an average of 148.1 minutes (and a median of 
74 minutes) of local news per weekday and radio stations nationwide air an average of 77.4 minutes (and 
a median of 50 minutes) of local news per weekday.426 According to the report, 84.6 percent of 
commercial radio stations air local news, and 80 percent of local radio groups include at least one station 
that airs local news.427 In addition, a 2014 study by the Media Insight Project revealed that 65 percent of 
Americans used radio to get news during the previous week and that Americans across all generations

continue to seek out traditional sources of news, including radio, despite the availability of news through 
social media and its accessibility on a variety of devices and technologies.428  
156. Moreover, there is some evidence in the record that members of certain communities may 
rely more heavily on broadcast radio stations for local news and information.  For example, NHMC 
provides data that demonstrate radio�s importance in Latino communities.  Among other findings, NHMC 
cites evidence that more than half of Latinos regularly turn to radio for at least some of their news.429  
UCC et al. provide evidence that radio stations played a meaningful role preceding the 2008 presidential 
election in disseminating political news and increasing voter participation in the African-American 
community.430 Such reliance may be especially strong when radio stations target particular demographic 
groups or offer news programs in a foreign language.  For example, a community radio station recently 
licensed in Minneapolis reports local news stories in the Somali language and provides information of 
particular interest to the local Somali-American community.431  
157. Evidence of reliance on broadcast radio for local news and public information 
programming is important for assessing radio�s contributions to viewpoint diversity; however, to be a 
meaningful source of viewpoint diversity in local markets, broadcast radio stations must increase the 
diversity of local information, not simply its availability.432 The record demonstrates that radio stations 
still contribute to viewpoint diversity by producing a meaningful amount of local news and public interest 
programming that is responsive to the needs and concerns of the community.  Commenters state that 
original radio programs often address issues of local interest involving, among other things, health care, 
politics, and immigration.433 For example, NHMC discusses the influence of Latino radio stations in 
mobilizing support for immigration rallies that were held across the country in 2006 in response to 
proposed federal legislation.434 UCC et al. list HIV/AIDS awareness, domestic violence, and hurricane 
safety among the topics addressed by a hip-hop music station in the Washington, D.C., market.435 In

neighbo/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS.  Although the NBCO Rule does not apply to that particular 
station due to its low-power status, the example nonetheless demonstrates the important contributions that radio can 
make to viewpoint diversity.  
432 See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4429, para. 133 (�We tentatively find that the diversity of local news coverage is not 
enhanced by the fact that newspapers from around the world are only a click away.  Remote access to hometown 
sports scores and local weather reports expands the availability, but not the diversity, of information.�).

addition, UCC et al. submit numerous examples of minority-owned radio stations in different parts of the 
country that, in varying degrees, produce local news and public affairs programming.436 Moreover, 
invitations to �call-in� to a radio program offer local residents unique opportunities to participate 
interactively in a conversation about an issue of local concern.  For example, NHMC provides a 
description of a Colorado radio station serving the local Latino community that touts as its most popular 
talk show a weekly call-in program centered on immigration law issues.437  
158. For the foregoing reasons, we find that radio provides an important contribution to 
viewpoint diversity such that lifting the newspaper/radio cross-ownership restriction in all markets across-
the-board could sweep too broadly.438 We find that we must take care not to overlook the contributions to 
viewpoint diversity offered by radio stations, particularly to the extent that dedicated audiences of radio 
stations rely on radio as a valuable source of local news and information, and that radio stations provide 
an additional opportunity for civic engagement, as certain commenters attest.439 Thus, while the 
Commission previously has recognized that a radio station generally cannot be considered the equal of a 
newspaper or television station when it comes to providing news, in fact, for a significant portion of the 
population radio may play an influential role as a �source for news or [�] the medium turned to for 
discussion of matters of local concern.�440  
159. Accordingly, we find that radio stations can contribute in a meaningful way to viewpoint 
diversity within local communities and that a newspaper�s purchase of a radio station in the same local 
market could harm viewpoint diversity in certain circumstances.  As a result, we retain both the 
newspaper/radio and the newspaper/television cross-ownership restrictions (for the reasons discussed 
above).  However, consistent with previous Commission findings, we believe that enforcement of the 
NBCO Rule may not be necessary to promote viewpoint diversity in every circumstance and that there 
could be situations where enforcement would disserve the public interest.441 For example, a 
newspaper/radio combination might not pose a significant risk of harm in a market that contains 
numerous radio stations that offer a substantial amount of local news programming.  Furthermore, we 
reaffirm the Commission�s earlier findings that the opportunity to share newsgathering resources and 
realize other efficiencies derived from economies of scale and scope may improve the ability of 
commonly owned media outlets to provide local news and information.442 In certain circumstances, 
newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership may benefit the news offerings in a local market without causing 
undue harm to viewpoint diversity.  In recognition of this, as discussed below, we will ease the 
application of the prohibition through a waiver process and other modifications to the scope of the rule.
160. Localism.  Several opponents of the rule argue that, as the Commission previously has 
recognized, newspaper/broadcast combinations can promote localism by creating efficiencies that cross-

owned properties can use to produce a higher quantity and quality of news and information 
programming.443 Citing Commission studies, NAA states that, on average, a cross-owned television 
station produces almost 50 percent more local news, provides 30 percent more coverage of local and state 
political candidates, and airs 40 percent more time to candidates� speeches and comments than other 
commercial stations.444 Several commenters assert that the NBCO Rule affirmatively harms local 
journalism by preventing combinations that could enhance efficiencies in local news production and 
distribution.445 In response, Free Press argues that it is not surprising that cross-owned television stations 
claim to have superior reporting abilities given their competitive advantage over stations unaffiliated with 
the local newspaper.446 Free Press points to the finding in Media Ownership Study 4 and a previous Free 
Press study that even if a cross-owned television station itself produces more local news, the overall effect 
of cross-ownership at the market level can be a reduction in total local news available to the market due to 
the so-called �crowding out effect.�447 However, as explained in the FNPRM, the results of Media 
Ownership Study 4 were largely inconclusive.448
161. Cox and SCP argue that eliminating the newspaper/radio cross-ownership restriction 
would promote localism by revitalizing local news on radio stations and by allowing newspapers to 
maximize efficiencies of scale.449  Bonneville/Scranton also argues that allowing newspaper/radio 
combinations would promote localism by providing struggling newspapers with a broader base of 
financial support and an increased ability to reach audiences.450  SCP and Delmarva et al. argue that the 
prohibition unnecessarily restricts investment that would benefit both newspapers and radio stations and 
that allowing them to share expertise, resources, and capital would bolster their abilities to provide news

and information.451 NAB states that Commission studies have found that cross-owned radio stations are 
more likely to air news and public affairs programming and are four to five times more likely to have a 
news format than a non-cross-owned station.452 Morris claims that its cross-owned radio stations are the 
only radio stations in their respective markets providing local news.453  
162. We affirm our belief that �the nation�s interest in maintaining a robust democracy 
through a �multiplicity of voices� justifies maintaining certain NBCO restrictions even if doing so 
prevents some combinations that might create cost-savings and efficiencies in news production.�454 While 
FNPRM commenters proffer further examples in support of the proposition that such cost-savings and 
efficiencies may allow cross-owned properties to provide a higher quality and quantity of local news, 
these additional examples do not change our conclusion.455 The Commission has long accepted that 
proposition but also recognized that increased efficiencies do not necessarily lead to localism benefits.456  
Furthermore, even if cost-savings are used to increase investment in local news production, the purpose of 
this rule is to promote and preserve the widest possible range of viewpoint; it is not, as NAB seems to 
suggest, to promote localism.457 We therefore disagree with NAB�s argument that retaining cross-
ownership restrictions will stymie the rule�s intended benefits.458 Allowing media owners to achieve 
economies of scale and scope may enable them to disseminate a greater amount of local news over one or 
both of their cross-owned properties, but the costly result would be fewer independently owned outlets in 
the market.  The loss of a local voice runs counter to our goal of promoting viewpoint diversity, 
regardless of whether cross-ownership is more or less likely to produce localism benefits.  Although the 
Commission has found previously that the NBCO Rule is not necessary to promote its localism goal, that 
determination, which we affirm today, does not undermine the viewpoint diversity rationale for the 
rule.459  
163. Competition.  Promoting competition was not the Commission�s primary concern when it 
considered implementation of the NBCO Rule,460 and in its 2002 biennial review the Commission found 
that the rule was not necessary to promote competition because newspapers and broadcast stations do not

compete in the same product markets.461 The National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters, Inc. 
(NABOB) disputes the Commission�s longstanding conclusion and claims that radio stations do compete 
with newspapers for advertisers.462 In response, NAA notes that the Commission adopted its view from 
findings by the Department of Justice and the courts that the advertising markets for broadcasters and 
newspapers are distinct product markets.463  Bonneville/Scranton asserts that NABOB provides data 
showing merely the relative usage of different advertising platforms, not the degree of actual competition 
for advertisers.464 Morris and NAA argue that the fact that both newspapers and radio stations earn local 
advertising revenues does not make them economic substitutes.465 NAA contends that the pertinent issue 
is whether newspapers and radio stations compete against each other for local news, not for advertising.466  
164. A few FNPRM commenters raise concerns with respect to competition arising from new 
forms of media, as opposed to competition between newspapers and broadcasters.  Commenters argue 
that repeal of the NBCO Rule is essential to relieve the struggling newspaper and broadcast industries, 
which they argue have suffered revenue declines and audience fragmentation, particularly as a result of 
the challenges that new technologies pose to traditional business models.467 Morris agrees that the 
obstacles facing the traditional media industry are part of a long-term trend and not a temporary effect of 
the global recession.468 NAA attributes the steep decline in newspaper advertising revenues to the 
�disaggregation of advertising from news� caused by online entities such as Craigslist and other non-news 
outlets.469 NAA and NAB urge the Commission to permit traditional news outlets to respond to these 
competitive challenges by achieving economies of scale through common ownership of newspapers and 
broadcast stations.470 In addition, Morris argues that allowing broadcasters to own multiple television 
and/or radio stations puts newspaper owners at an unfair competitive disadvantage.471

or necessary strategy for reversing the declining fortunes of traditional news outlets.  The Screen Actors

Guild?American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) warns that �[m]ore 
ownership concentration means fewer jobs for media professionals, which results in fewer independent 
news sources and editorial perspectives in news coverage.�472 It argues that the rapid consolidation in the 
media marketplace is a reason to strengthen the NBCO Rule, not weaken it.473 Free Press contends that 
eliminating or weakening the NBCO Rule would risk consumer harm unnecessarily because the predicted 
�impending doom� of newspapers has not occurred.474 It points to the splitting apart of several 
newspaper/broadcast conglomerates as evidence of newspapers� hopes for a more profitable future.475  
Wick responds that the spinning off of newspaper assets reflects an attempt to prevent struggling print 
enterprises from dragging down the stock prices of the profitable businesses of media conglomerates.476
166. The FNPRM record does not change our longstanding position that the NBCO Rule is not 
necessary to promote competition given that newspapers and broadcasters do not compete in the same 
product markets.477 We agree with the view of several commenters that NABOB has not presented a 
convincing case to the contrary.478 The fact that broadcasters and newspapers both sell to local advertisers
does not mean they compete with each other for advertising.  
167. Although we do not find that the rule is necessary to promote competition, we have 
concluded that it is necessary to promote viewpoint diversity.  Therefore, we are not swayed by the media 
industry�s arguments that the NBCO Rule should be eliminated because it potentially limits opportunities 
for newspapers and broadcasters to expand their businesses.  As we stated in the FNPRM, we do not 
believe that viewpoint diversity in local markets should be jeopardized in order to enable media owners to 
increase their revenue by pursuing cross-ownership within the same local market.479 Moreover, the 
application of the NBCO Rule has a very limited geographic scope.  Even if the potential efficiencies of 
inter-market consolidation are fewer than those to be gained from in-market acquisitions, the rule does not 
prevent media owners that seek new revenue streams from acquiring properties in other markets or 
alternative media outlets that are not subject to the NBCO Rule.

community in which the newspaper is published.480 The trigger for the newspaper/television cross-
ownership restriction therefore relies on a station�s Grade A contour, which was rendered obsolete by the 
transition to digital television service.  In the FNPRM, the Commission tentatively concluded that the 
geographic scope of the newspaper/television cross-ownership restriction should be updated to reflect the 
fact that analog Grade A contours can no longer be used to determine when the rule is triggered.481  
Previously, in the NPRM, the Commission sought comment on whether the cross-ownership prohibition 
should be triggered when a daily newspaper and a television station are in the same Nielsen DMA.482 In 
response to concerns that such an approach would expand the rule�s application too broadly, the 
Commission instead proposed in the FNPRM that the rule be triggered for newspaper/television 
combinations when both:  (1) the television station and the newspaper are in the same Nielsen DMA and 
(2) the PCC of the television station encompasses the entire community in which the newspaper is 
published.483 The Commission�s proposed approach received support, and no opposition, from FNPRM
commenters.484
169. We adopt our uncontested proposal in the FNPRM to update the geographic scope of the 
restriction by incorporating both a television station�s DMA and its digital service contour.485  
Specifically, cross-ownership of a full-power television station and a daily newspaper will be prohibited 
when:  (1) the community of license of the television station and the community of publication of the 
newspaper are in the same Nielsen DMA, and (2) the PCC of the television station, as defined in Section 
73.625 of the Commission�s rules, encompasses the entire community in which the newspaper is 
published.486 Both conditions need to be met in order for the cross-ownership prohibition to be triggered.  
The DMA requirement ensures that the newspaper and television station serve the same media market, 
and the contour requirement ensures that they actually reach the same communities and consumers within 
that larger geographic market.487  
  
480 47 CFR � 73.3555(d)(1)(iii).  The Commission retained the Grade A contour approach when it revised the NBCO 
Rule in 2006.  2006 Quadrennial Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2093, App. A.

485 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4441-42, para. 159.  Cox and AFCP support the Commission�s combined approach, in 
part because incorporating the PCC of a television station will ensure that the rule�s coverage does not extend to 
outlets located in distant parts of large DMAs.  Cox FNPRM Comments at 2-3, 7-8; AFCP FNPRM Comments at 6.  
Cox would prefer, however, that the Commission use a digital equivalent to the analog Grade A contour instead of 
the PCC.  Cox FNPRM Comments at 7-8.  As we explained in the FNPRM, we rejected Cox�s suggestion because a 
digital equivalent to the analog Grade A contour has not been defined and the PCC is a defined contour that can be 
verified in a straightforward manner, which ensures reliable service for the community of license.  FNPRM, 29 FCC 
Rcd at 4442, para. 160 n.460.  Cox did not dispute our reasoning in its further comments, and we affirm our 
rejection of its suggestion herein.     
486 47 CFR � 73.625.  For the reasons provided in the FNPRM, we will maintain the current definition of a daily 
newspaper as one �which is published four or more days per week, which is in the dominant language in the market, 
and which is circulated generally in the community of publication.�  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4443-44, para. 164; 
see also 47 CFR � 73.3555, Note 6.  We explained our disinclination to revise the definition, for example by 
imposing a minimum circulation requirement, and FNPRM commenters did not address the issue further.

the local television ownership rule).  Cox agrees that using DMAs will provide an accurate way to define the market 
and will prevent the rule from triggering in situations where a station�s contour reaches a distinct and separate 
audience in a different DMA.  Cox FNPRM Comments at 2-3, 7-8 (claiming that DMAs are �a better measure of 
audience reach and economic market overlap than station contours�).

170. Newspaper/Radio Combinations.  In the NPRM, the Commission sought comment on 
whether the trigger for the newspaper/radio cross-ownership restriction should continue to rely on radio 
contours or whether Nielsen Audio market definitions should be used instead.488 Consistent with 
arguments made in the record, we will not replace radio contours, but instead we will include an 
additional requirement that the radio station and the newspaper be located in the same Nielsen Audio 
Metro market, where one is defined.489 In circumstances in which neither the radio station nor the 
newspaper is geographically located within a defined Nielsen Audio Metro market, then the trigger will 
be determined, as before, solely on the basis of the station�s service contour.490 We agree with Morris that 
the added Nielsen Audio Metro market condition will �serve a valid limiting role� because Nielsen Audio 
designations are based on listening patterns, which will focus the restriction on properties serving the 
same audience.491  
171. Specifically, in areas designated as Nielsen Audio Metro markets, cross-ownership of a 
full-power radio station and a daily newspaper will be prohibited when:  (1) the radio station and the 
community of publication of the newspaper are located in the same Nielsen Audio Metro market, and 
(2) the entire community in which the newspaper is published is encompassed within the service contour 
of the station, namely:  (a) the predicted or measured 2 mV/m groundwave contour of an AM station, 
computed in accordance with Section 73.183 or Section 73.186; or (b) the predicted or measured 1 mV/m 
contour for an FM station, computed in accordance with Section 73.313.  Both conditions need to be met 
in order for the cross-ownership restriction to apply, except when both the community of publication of 
the newspaper and the community of license of the radio station are not located in a Nielsen Audio Metro 
market, then only the second condition need be met.  Consistent with the Local Radio Ownership Rule, 
we will rely on Nielsen to determine whether a radio station is in the same Nielsen Audio Metro market 
as the newspaper�s community of publication.492 Specifically, for purposes of this rule, a radio station 
will be counted as part of the Nielsen Audio Metro market in which the station�s community of license is 
geographically located and any other Nielsen Audio Metro market in which the station is listed by BIA as 
�home� to that market.493 This approach will ensure that a radio station is considered to be part of each 
Nielsen Audio Metro market in which that station is either geographically located or competes. We 
believe Nielsen�s determination of a radio market�s boundaries is useful in considering whether particular 
communities rely on the same media voices.  We believe that such a determination, combined with the 
  
488 NPRM, 26 FCC Rcd at 17530-31, paras. 113-14; see also FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4435, para. 144 n.413.  The 
current rule prohibits cross-ownership when the entire community in which the newspaper is published would be 
encompassed within the service contour of:  (1) the predicted or measured 2 mV/m contour of an AM station, 
computed in accordance with Section 73.183 or Section 73.186, or (2) the predicted 1 mV/m contour for an FM 
station, computed in accordance with Section 73.313.  See 47 CFR � 73.3555(d) (2002).
489 Both Cox and Morris urge the Commission to use Nielsen Audio Metro markets to help define the scope of any 
newspaper/radio cross-ownership restriction that the Commission retains.  Cox NPRM Comments at 24-25; Cox 
FNPRM Comments at 7 n.16; Morris FNPRM Comments at 30-31; see also Morris NPRM Comments at 21-22.
490 See Cox NPRM Comments at 25.
491 Morris FNPRM Comments at 30-31 (urging the Commission to eliminate the newspaper/radio cross-ownership 
restriction, but supporting the condition in the event the Commission retained the restriction).
492 The Local Radio Ownership Rule relies, in part, on Nielsen Audio Metro markets in applying the radio 
ownership limits. In that context, the Commission has developed certain procedural safeguards to deter parties from 
attempting to manipulate Nielsen Audio market definitions to evade the Local Radio Ownership Rules. By relying 
on Nielsen Audio Metro markets, where available, our revised NBCO Rule is susceptible to similar manipulation by 
parties; accordingly, we will apply the procedures adopted in the context of the Local Radio Ownership Rule to the 
NBCO Rule we adopt today.  See, e.g., 2002 Biennial Review Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 13726, para. 278; supra para. 
108 (adopting additional procedures in the Local Radio Ownership Rule context). 
493 See 2002 Biennial Review Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 13726-28, paras. 279-81 (discussing methodology for 
determining which stations are counted as part of a Nielsen Audio market).

actual service areas of the respective facilities, gives a stronger picture of the relevant market and 
instances in which we should prohibit common ownership.  Therefore, as Morris notes in its comments, 
we believe that including consideration of the Nielsen Audio Metro market (if one exists) in the 
determination of when the cross-ownership prohibition is triggered will help focus the restriction 
specifically on those circumstances where the newspaper and broadcast facility truly serve the same 
audience.494
c. Exception for Failed and Failing Broadcast Stations and Newspapers
172. In the FNPRM, the Commission sought comment on whether to create an exception to 
the NBCO Rule, regardless of the waiver standard adopted, when one of the entities in the proposed 
combination is either failed or failing.495 The Commission asked whether it should adopt the criteria used 
in the 2006 rule for failed/failing entities.496 The Commission posited that �the continued operation of a 
local news outlet under common ownership would cause less harm to viewpoint diversity than would its 
complete disappearance from the market.�497  FNPRM commenters did not address the specifics of the 
issue, but the Association of Free Community Papers (AFCP) supports the concept of taking into account 
whether a proposed merger involves a failed/failing entity.498
173. Consistent with our proposal in the FNPRM, we will adopt an express exception for 
proposed combinations involving a failed or failing newspaper, television station, or radio station.499 It 
stands to reason that a merger involving a failed or failing newspaper or broadcast station is not likely to 
harm viewpoint diversity in the local market.  If the entity is unable to continue as a standalone operation, 
and thus contribute to viewpoint diversity, then preventing its disappearance from the market potentially 
can enhance, and will not diminish, viewpoint diversity.  
174. We adopt failed/failing criteria consistent with those proposed in the FNPRM, which are 
similar to those used for the Local Television Ownership Rule and the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership 
Rule.500 That is, a �failed� newspaper or broadcast station must show that, as applicable, it had stopped 
circulating or had been dark due to financial distress for at least four months immediately prior to the 
filing of the assignment or transfer of control application, or that it was involved in court-supervised 
involuntary bankruptcy or involuntary insolvency proceedings.501 To qualify as �failing,� the applicant 
  
494 Morris FNPRM Comments at 30-31.
495 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4453-54, para. 188.  In the FNPRM, the Commission proposed not to adopt the 2006 
exception for proposed mergers involving a broadcast station that does not offer local newscasts but that commits to 
airing at least seven hours of local news per week after the transaction.  Id. at 4453, para. 187.  FNPRM commenters 
did not address this issue.  For the reasons expressed in the FNPRM, we will not create such an exception.  Id. at 
4452-53, paras. 186-87.  Our current approach will not preclude waiver applicants from attempting to show how 
such a commitment could enhance viewpoint diversity in the local market.  However, applicants seeking a waiver in 
part or in whole on that basis should recall our previously stated concerns that such a commitment would be 
impracticable to enforce and arguably might require us to make content-based assessments.  See id. at 4453, para. 
187.  
496 Id. at 4453-54, para. 188.
497 Id.  The Commission discussed the issue with respect to newspaper/television combinations, but the same policy 
concerns apply to radio stations.  
498 AFCP FNPRM Comments at 7.
499 For the reasons explained below in connection with the timing of a waiver request, we will require television and 
radio licensees to file for an exception to the NBCO Rule prior to consummating the acquisition of a newspaper.  
See infra at para. 183.
500 See 2006 Quadrennial Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2047-48, para. 65; 47 CFR � 73.3555, Note 7.
501 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4453-54, para. 188 (citing 2006 Quadrennial Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2047-48, 
para. 65).

would have to show that:  (1) if a broadcast television station is the failing entity, that it has had a low all-
day audience share (i.e., 4 percent or lower); (2) the financial condition of the newspaper or broadcast 
station was poor (i.e., a negative cash flow for the previous three years); and (3) the combination would 
produce public interest benefits.502  In addition, the applicants must show that the in-market buyer is the 
only reasonably available candidate willing and able to acquire and operate the failed or failing 
newspaper or station and that selling the newspaper or station to any out-of-market buyer would result in 
an artificially depressed price.503
175. Because we are creating an exception to the NBCO Rule, rather than a waiver 
opportunity, applicants seeking a failed/failing entity exception need not show, either at the time of their 
application or during subsequent license renewals, that the tangible and verifiable public interest benefits 
of the combination outweigh any harms.504  As we have concluded that the exception serves the public 
interest in diversity simply by preserving a media outlet, it is not necessary for licensees to demonstrate 
that the additional benefits outweigh the potential harms.  Recognizing that an absolute ban on 
newspaper/broadcast cross ownership is overly broad, we believe it is appropriate to provide greater 
flexibility and certainty in the context of this rule.  Thus, we believe a clear exception to the rule for failed 
and failing entities, rather than a waiver requiring a balancing of the harms and benefits, is appropriate to 
provide certainty for relief, as we believe such combinations will have a minimal impact on viewpoint 
diversity.505   
d. Waiver Standard
176. In the NPRM and the FNPRM, the Commission proposed to retain the general prohibition 
on newspaper/broadcast combinations, subject to various waiver criteria, rather than to revise the 
restriction to allow combinations under certain expressly prescribed circumstances.506 In the FNPRM, we 
sought comment on two different approaches for handling waiver requests:  a pure case-by-case approach 
entailing a review of the totality of circumstances of each individual case, and a case-by-case approach 
guided by a set of presumptions favoring or disfavoring proposed combinations depending on whether 
they meet certain criteria.507 As described below, the Commission also sought comment on whether it 
should retain the waiver criteria that the Commission contemplated in connection with its divestiture 
  
502 Id.; see also 2006 Quadrennial Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2047-48, para. 65.  In addition, as with the 
exemption for satellite television stations pursuant to Note 5 of Section 73.3555, in the event of an assignment of 
license or transfer of control of the broadcast/newspaper combination, the proposed assignee or transferee would 
need to make an appropriate showing demonstrating compliance with the elements of the failed/failing entity 
exception at the time of the assignment or transfer if it wishes to continue the common ownership pursuant to this 
exception.  Further, although we are not including this failed/failing exception in Note 7 of Section 73.3555 of the 
Commission�s rules (which addresses the failed/failing waiver criteria applicable to the local television ownership 
rule and the radio/television cross-ownership rule), given the similarities, the precedent established in the application 
of Note 7 shall apply to the application of the NBCO failed/failing criteria, as appropriate.  
503 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4453-54, para. 188; see also 2006 Quadrennial Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2048, 
para. 65; 47 CFR � 73.3555, Note 7.  One way to satisfy this requirement would be to provide an affidavit from an 
independent broker affirming that active and serious efforts had been made to sell the newspaper or broadcast 
station, and that no reasonable offer from an entity outside the market had been received.  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at

requirement when it first adopted the NBCO Rule.508 Finally, the Commission asked whether a licensee 
should be required to file a waiver request at the time it seeks to acquire a newspaper, rather than at the 
time of its license renewal, in order to enable a timely public response to the proposed merger.509  
177. In the FNPRM, we sought comment on various criteria that could be included if we were 
to adopt a presumptive waiver standard.510 Borrowing from the waiver standard in the 2006 rules, the 
FNPRM first asked whether the Commission should favor waiver requests for newspaper/broadcast 
combinations within the top 20 DMAs and disfavor waiver requests for newspaper/broadcast 
combinations in all other markets.511 Second, it sought comment on whether proposed 
newspaper/television combinations should be granted a favorable presumption only if they involved a 
television station that was not ranked among the top four television stations in the DMA.512 The FNPRM
tentatively concluded that viewpoint diversity in even the largest markets could be harmed if a top-four 
television station merged with a newspaper because those stations typically generate more local news than 
lower-ranked stations.513 Third, the FNPRM proposed to favor only those transactions where at least eight 
independently owned and operated �major media voices� would remain in the DMA post-transaction.514  
The FNPRM further proposed to retain the current definition of major media voices, which includes only 
full-power television stations and newspapers published at least four days a week within the DMA in the 
dominant language of the market and circulated to more than five percent of the DMA�s households.515  
  
508 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4440, para. 155.  At the time it adopted the NBCO Rule, the Commission required the 
divestiture of a number of newspaper/broadcast combinations, but it indicated that a waiver of its divestiture 
requirement might be appropriate where:  (1) there was an inability to dispose of an interest to conform to the rules; 
(2) the only possible sale was at an artificially depressed price; (3) separate ownership of the newspaper and station 
could not be supported in the locality; or (4) the purposes of the rule would be disserved by divestiture. 1975

509 See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4439, para. 153.    
510 The FNPRM proposed not to subject waiver requests to the four-factor test that applied to all waiver requests 
under the 2006 rule.  It tentatively concluded that the factors were vague, subjective, difficult to verify, and costly to 
enforce.  Id. at 4452, para. 184.  The four-factor test examined:  (1) the likelihood that the combined entity would 
increase significantly the amount of local news in the market; (2) the extent to which the newspaper and the 
broadcast outlets each would continue to employ its own staff and exercise its own independent news judgment; 
(3) the level of concentration in the Nielsen DMA; and (4) the financial condition of the newspaper or broadcast 
station, and if the newspaper or broadcast station was in financial distress, the proposed owner�s commitment to 
invest significantly in newsroom operations.  See 2006 Quadrennial Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2049-54, paras.

178. Proponents of the rule support a general prohibition with no built-in or codified 
exemptions.516 In contrast, other commenters argue that adding exemptions would not narrow the rule 
enough; instead, they urge the Commission to eliminate the entire restriction.517  
179. Commenters also disagree about the type of waiver approach that the Commission should 
use if it decides to retain the general prohibition but grant waivers when appropriate.518 Free Press 
supports a pure case-by-case waiver approach and opposes awarding favorable presumptions for any 
waiver requests.519 Free Press warns that a presumptive waiver standard would invite gamesmanship 
among broadcasters �to match deals against a set of pre-fabricated factors.�520 It asserts that an 
examination of the facts of each case would be the best protection against the loss of an independent 
voice.521 Similarly, WGAW favors retention of the cross-ownership ban without the inclusion of any 
specific waiver criteria.522 WGAW argues that the Commission�s proposition to allow a favorable 
presumption for waiver requests in the top 20 DMAs would not support diversity or localism.523
180. On the other hand, Cox opposes a pure case-by-case waiver approach, which it views as a 
retreat from the Commission�s previous presumptive waiver standards.524 Cox argues that businesses 
need a predictable waiver standard in order to develop effective business plans and to encourage the 
expensive planning and investment required for integrating news operations.525  Cox re-submits its own 
proposal for a presumptive waiver standard, which it argues should apply to NBCO waiver requests in all 
markets.  Cox argues that the first part of its two-part test would protect diversity by requiring that at least 
20 independently owned major media voices remain in the market following a newspaper/broadcast 
combination.  Cox would consider major media voices to include independently owned daily newspapers,

full-power television and radio stations, cable and satellite television systems (counted as one voice), and 
the Internet (counted as one voice).  Arguing that the Commission confuses its diversity policy with its 
localism policy, Cox believes that these outlets should be counted regardless of the extent to which they 
provide local news and information.  The second part of Cox�s test, intended to preserve localism, would 
require that at least three independent media voices that produce and distribute local news and 
information programming, other than the combining properties, remain in the market post-transaction.  
Cox dismisses the Commission�s concern that qualifying an outlet as a producer of local news would be a 
content-based determination.526  
181. There is little support for the presumptive waiver approach that the Commission offered 
for consideration.  Cox and NAA claim that a favorable presumption only for the top 20 markets would 
harm small and mid-sized markets where investment in local newsrooms may be most needed.527  In 
addition, NAA is critical of a top-four television restriction, which it argues would deny relief to those 
television stations most likely to produce local news and therefore most likely to benefit from the 
economies of scale of merging with a newspaper.528 In contrast, AFCP would prefer that the Commission 
adopt a neutral, rather than a favorable, approach for proposed newspaper/television combinations in the 
top 20 DMAs and for those involving television stations ranked below the top four stations in the 
DMA.529 It recommends a �strong� negative presumption for proposed mergers not meeting those 
criteria.530 AFCP supports the eight voices test but recommends that the Commission consider requiring a 
higher number of voices in the very largest markets.531
182. Consistent with our tentative conclusion in the FNPRM, we decline to adopt a bright-line 
rule that would exempt certain combinations from the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule based on 
a certain set of criteria.532 Given the variability among local markets, we maintain our view that blanket 
exemptions should not be built into the rule.  As we explained in the FNPRM, while a rule with built-in 
exemptions might lend greater certainty to parties considering a merger, it would not lead necessarily to 
the best result in an individual market.533 We reiterate our concern that such a rule would be �too blunt an 
instrument� to be used for these types of mergers because, for example, �allowing certain combinations 
only in the top 20 DMAs could foreclose merger opportunities in smaller markets where viewpoint 
diversity is sufficiently robust� and, conversely, �permit combinations in a top 20 DMA that would harm 
the public interest.�534 Rather, we believe that the more prudent way to ease the rule�s application is 
through a case-by-case waiver process with a particular focus on the impact the proposed merger would 
have on viewpoint diversity in the market.

183. Therefore, consistent with our other efforts to ease the rule�s application, we provide for 
the consideration of waiver requests of the NBCO Rule on a case-by-case basis.535 We believe a case-by-
case waiver approach will �produce sensible outcomes and also improve transparency and public 
participation in the process.�536 To facilitate public participation further, we will require television and 
radio licensees to file a request for waiver of the NBCO Rule prior to consummating the acquisition of a 
newspaper, rather than at the time of the station�s license renewal.537 As we explained in the FNPRM, a 
broadcast licensee that triggered the NBCO Rule with the purchase of a newspaper previously was 
required, absent a waiver, to dispose of its station within one year or by the time of its next renewal date, 
whichever was longer.538 Alternatively, it could have pursued a waiver in conjunction with its license 
renewal, at which point interested parties could comment on the waiver request.  As a result, the 
opportunity to comment on a licensee�s acquisition of a newspaper might have arisen years after the 
purchase.  Our remedy will enable the public to comment on such acquisitions in a timely and effective 
manner before the purchase is consummated.  Moreover, by requiring prior approval, this approach will 
provide certainty to transaction participants that the proposed combination will not be subject to potential 
divestiture after the operations already have been integrated�a certainty that is not provided by the 
current approach.  To alert interested parties to a proposed newspaper acquisition, we will require that the 
Media Bureau place such waiver requests on public notice and solicit public comment on the proposed 
acquisition.
184. With regard to the two case-by-case options that we described in the FNPRM for 
considering waivers, we adopt what we termed a �pure� case-by-case approach.539  That is, we will 
evaluate waiver requests by assessing �the totality of the circumstances for each individual transaction, 
considering each waiver request anew without measuring it against a set of defined criteria or awarding 
the applicant an automatic presumption based on a prima facie showing of particular elements.�540  
Waiver applicants will have the flexibility to present their most compelling reasons why strict application 
of the rule is not necessary to promote the goal of viewpoint diversity in that particular local market.541  
Thus, an applicant seeking a waiver under this approach will have to show that grant of the waiver will 
not unduly harm viewpoint diversity.  Likewise, opponents of a transaction can respond with a range of 
arguments and evidence they consider most pertinent to that case.  We believe this approach will provide

(detailing the four factors).  As we stated in the FNPRM, evidence supporting considerations like those reflected in 
the four factors, although not required, is also not discouraged if a waiver applicant believes it would be useful in 
supporting its request.  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4452, para. 184.

the Commission the flexibility needed to allow due consideration of all factors relevant to a case, without 
spending time and resources assessing presumptive criteria that may not be useful for a particular 
review.542 Thus, the Commission can hone in quickly on the most important considerations of the 
proposed transaction and approach them with an openness that might not occur with a set framework.543  
We believe that, as a result, the Commission will be able to determine more accurately and precisely 
whether a proposed combination will have an adverse impact on viewpoint diversity in the relevant local 
market.  If a proposed combination does not present any undue harm to viewpoint diversity, which is the 
underlying purpose of the rule, then it is not necessary in the public interest to prohibit the combination.  
185. We recognize that a case-by-case approach with presumptive guidelines, such as the one 
described in the FNPRM, potentially could offer waiver applicants greater certainty and consistency.  The 
criteria proposed in this proceeding, however, were widely criticized and rejected by commenters.544 For 
example, while newspaper and broadcast industry commenters support a predictable waiver standard, 
these commenters assert that it would be overly restrictive to distinguish markets below the top 20 DMAs 
and mergers with top-ranked television stations, as proposed in this proceeding.545 Ultimately, we are 
persuaded by the criticism in the record that the proposed presumptive guidelines should not be adopted.  
Moreover, we are concerned that any presumptive approach could result in an unduly rigid evaluation of a 
waiver application.  Instead, as discussed above, we believe that the pure case-by-case approach is the 
appropriate way to assess requests for waiver of the NBCO Rule.  For all the reasons that favor a pure 
case-by-case approach, plus those stated in the FNPRM, we decline to adopt Cox�s proposal for a two-
part test that would measure every proposed transaction against the same set of fixed criteria.546 As we 
stated in the FNPRM, we believe that the first part of Cox�s proposed test would define independent 
media voices too broadly and that the second part of Cox�s proposed test would be difficult to apply and 
enforce in an objective, content-neutral manner.547
186. In addition, we disagree with Cox that a pure case-by-case approach is necessarily a 
retreat from a presumptive waiver standard.548  Rather, a pure case-by-case approach lifts the potential 
burden of having to overcome a negative presumption.  Regardless, our intent in choosing a pure case-by-
case approach over a presumptive waiver standard is not to increase or decrease the number of waiver 
approvals; it is to increase the likelihood of achieving the proper result in each individual case.  Applying 
presumptive criteria can work well in other contexts and for other rules, but, under the current record and 
given the nature of viewpoint diversity and its dependency on the particular facts and circumstances of a 
specific market, we find that a pure case-by-case approach is best suited for handling requests for waiver 
of this rule.  
  
542 The 2006 rule required a waiver applicant attempting to overcome a negative presumption to show, with clear 
and convincing evidence, that the merged entity would increase diversity and competition.  2006 Quadrennial 
Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2049, para. 68.  In the FNPRM, we proposed not to incorporate the requirement into 
any presumptive waiver standard that we might adopt.  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4453, para. 187.  FNPRM
commenters did not address the issue, and our concern remains that the requirement would impose �an overly 
burdensome evidentiary standard.�  See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 44553, para. 187.  Although the issue arguably is 
mooted by our decision not to adopt a presumptive waiver standard, we also will not incorporate that standard into 
our adopted waiver approach.

187. We also disagree with Cox that a pure case-by-case approach is the equivalent of not 
having a waiver standard.549 To be clear, our standard requires applicants seeking a waiver of the NBCO 
Rule to show that their proposed combination would not unduly harm viewpoint diversity in the local 
market.  The pure case-by-case approach describes the method by which we will determine whether this 
standard is met.  Our method of examining the totality of the circumstances may entail a broad review, 
but the standard to be met is narrowly focused on the impact on viewpoint diversity.  We anticipate that 
the precedent that evolves from future waiver decisions will provide further guidance to entities 
considering a merger.  
188. We clarify that this waiver standard is distinct from the traditional waiver standard under 
Section 1.3, which requires a showing of �good cause� and applies to all Commission rules.550 By 
specifically allowing for a waiver of the NBCO Rule in cases where applicants can demonstrate that the 
proposed combination will not unduly harm viewpoint diversity, we signal our recognition that there may 
be instances where enforcing the prohibition against ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station is 
not necessary to serve the rule�s purpose of promoting viewpoint diversity in the local market.  Indeed, it 
is our determination herein that the public interest would not be served by restricting specific 
combinations that do not unduly harm viewpoint diversity.  While in the context of Section 1.3 waiver 
requests the Commission has considered showings of undue hardship, the equities of a particular case, or 
other good cause, in this particular context an applicant is required to make a narrower showing, and a 
waiver will be granted so long as the applicants can demonstrate that viewpoint diversity will not be 
unduly harmed as a result of the proposed combination.  The NBCO waiver standard does not replace or 
limit a waiver applicant�s available options under Section 1.3.  Indeed, while the NBCO waiver standard 
we articulate focuses specifically on the impact of the proposed merger on viewpoint diversity in the local 
market and requires applicants to make a showing as to such impact, waiver requests under Section 1.3 
could include a broader public interest showing, under which parties can assert any variety of 
considerations they believe warrant waiver of the rule consistent with established precedent.551
189. Finally, the FNPRM sought comment on whether to adopt a waiver standard based on the 
divestiture waiver criteria that the Commission contemplated at the time it first adopted the NBCO Rule.  
At that time, the Commission grandfathered most existing newspaper/broadcast combinations, but it 
required divestiture for a small number of combinations in areas where there was an absence or near 
absence of other media.552 The Commission contemplated that a waiver of its divestiture requirement 
might be appropriate where:  (1) there was an inability to dispose of an interest to conform to the rules; 
(2) the only possible sale was at an artificially depressed price; (3) separate ownership of the newspaper 
and station could not be supported in the locality; or (4) the purposes of the rule would be disserved by 
  
549 See id. at 12.
550 47 CFR � 1.3; but see Free Press FNPRM Comments at 11 (appearing to equate a pure case-by-case approach 
with the Commission�s traditional waiver test); Free Press FNPRM Reply at 10-11.
551 Waiver of the Commission�s policies or rules under Section 1.3 is appropriate only if both (1) special 
circumstances warrant a deviation from the general rule, and (2) such deviation will serve the public interest.  See 
Network IP, LLC v. FCC, 548 F.3d 116, 125-28 (D.C. Cir. 2008); Northeast Cellular, 897 F.2d at 1166.  Under this 
section, the Commission may take into account considerations of hardship, equity, or more effective implementation 
of overall policy on an individual basis.  See WAIT Radio, 418 F.2d at 1157; Northeast Cellular, 897 F.2d at 1166.  
Although the Commission must give waiver requests �a hard look,� an applicant for waiver under Section 1.3 �faces 
a high hurdle even at the starting gate� and must support its waiver request with a compelling showing.  See WAIT 
Radio, 418 F.2d at 1157; Greater Media Radio Co., Inc., Memorandum Opinion and Order, 15 FCC Rcd 7090, 
7094, para. 9 (1999) (citing Stoner Broadcasting System, Inc., Memorandum Opinion and Order, 49 FCC 2d 1011, 
1012, para. 5 (1974)).

divestiture.553 Since then, these criteria also have been applied prospectively to new newspaper/broadcast 
combinations.554  FNPRM commenters did not address our question whether a case-by-case approach 
should incorporate, or disavow, these waiver criteria, which remain in effect along with the current rule.555  
Accordingly, in light of the lack of comment on these criteria (for or against), and for the reasons 
discussed above, we are adopting a new waiver standard that replaces these earlier divestiture waiver 
criteria.
e. Grandfathering
190. In the FNPRM, the Commission tentatively concluded that it should grandfather any 
existing combinations that would become non-compliant due to any changes it made to the rule, such as 
an update to the trigger requirement.556 It stated that it would continue to allow existing combinations that 
previously were grandfathered or approved by permanent waiver.  It sought comment on its view that any 
grandfathered or approved combinations that subsequently are transferred must come into compliance 
with the revised rule.557  NPRM commenters representing newspaper and broadcast owners supported 
grandfathering and argued that grandfathered and approved combinations should be freely transferable.558  
FNPRM commenters did not address grandfathering issues.
191. We will grandfather, to the extent required, any existing newspaper/broadcast 
combinations that no longer comply with the NBCO Rule as a result of our changes to the scope of the 
rule.  In addition, as stated in the FNPRM, we will continue to allow all combinations currently in 
existence that have been grandfathered or approved by permanent waiver to the extent that 
grandfathering/permanent waivers are still necessary to permit common ownership.559 Consistent with
Commission precedent, grandfathered combinations, including those subject to permanent waivers, are 
not transferrable.560  We disagree with commenters that assert that, contrary to longstanding Commission

precedent, grandfathered and approved combinations should be freely transferable in perpetuity.561  Our 
approach today strikes the appropriate balance between avoiding imposition of the hardship of divestiture 
on owners of existing combinations that have owned a combination in reliance on the rules and moving 
the industry toward compliance with current rules when owners voluntarily decide to sell their properties.  
A transferee or assignee of the properties must comply with the NBCO Rule in effect at the time of the 
transaction or obtain a new waiver.  This requirement applies to the transfer of existing combinations 
already grandfathered or approved and to the transfer of combinations grandfathered as a result of 
becoming non-compliant due to our changes to the scope of the rule.
f. Minority and Female Ownership
192. The FNPRM provided commenters another opportunity to address the relationship of the 
NBCO Rule to minority and female ownership.562 The Commission tentatively concluded that minority 
and female ownership would not be affected adversely by the proposed modifications to the NBCO 
Rule.563 The Commission noted a lack of evidence in the existing record to support the proposition that 
newspaper mergers with minority/women-owned radio stations would result in greater harm to viewpoint 
diversity in local markets than combinations involving radio stations that are not minority- or women-
owned.564 With respect to the newspaper/television cross-ownership restriction, the Commission was not 
persuaded that the modifications under consideration likely would affect minority and female ownership 
levels.565 The Commission sought further comment on its views.  In addition, the Commission described 
comments addressing a study submitted by MMTC, which found that cross-ownership generally is not a 
concern among minority and female broadcast station owners.566 The Commission stated that it could not 
draw definitive conclusions based solely on the study, but it invited commenters to provide new or 
additional evidence.567 The Commission asked whether a waiver requirement would protect its diversity 
goals adequately.568 It rejected the argument that the Prometheus II decision prevents the Commission 
from making any changes to the NBCO Rule without first showing that minority ownership would not be 
harmed.569  
193. Several commenters argue that newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership does not have a 
material adverse effect on minority and female ownership, and they assert that there are more targeted and

effective means of promoting ownership diversity than keeping the NBCO Rule.570 Bonneville/Scranton 
asserts that the large number of radio stations offers plenty of ownership opportunities for minorities and
women and that elimination of the newspaper/radio cross-ownership restriction would be unlikely to 
incite newspaper purchases of radio stations, given the current industry trend of spinning off newspaper
properties.571 NAA claims that cross-ownership benefits minority communities because newspaper 
owners try to diversify newsrooms and provide a voice for minority communities.572 Morris argues that 
increasing flexibility for broadcast owners would benefit all owners, including minority and female 
owners.573 NAA agrees with the Commission that the agency is not required to show that a rule change 
would have no impact on minority ownership levels before taking any action, and it questions how such a 
showing could even be made.574
194. Free Press, by contrast, criticizes the Commission�s tentative finding that the NBCO Rule 
does not have a significant effect on minority ownership.575 Free Press argues that consolidation in 
general makes it difficult for small businesses, such as those owned by minorities, to compete.576 It 
reasons that the Commission should not eliminate a restriction that promotes ownership diversity merely 
because the rule on its own may not be enough to maintain or increase minority ownership.577 Free Press 
claims that the Commission has not conducted a proper study of the potential adverse effects on 
ownership diversity and therefore has no basis upon which to relax the rule.578 While recognizing the 
small number of cross-owned properties available to study, Free Press suggests that a proper study would 
examine grandfathered newspaper/broadcast combinations separately from waived combinations, given 
the different histories and market positions of these two categories.579 AFCP reiterates its plea for the 
Commission to study the effects of consolidation, including cross-media consolidation, on smaller media 
owners, including disadvantaged, female, and minority owners.580
195. WGAW argues that eliminating the newspaper/radio cross-ownership restriction could 
encourage large corporations to target radio stations for acquisition.581 It warns that ownership diversity 
could decrease given that radio remains one of the affordable entry points for minorities and women into 
the communications industry.582 NHMC and UCC et al. likewise contend that the radio cross-ownership

rules help prevent consolidation and promote opportunities for new entrants.583 In addition, NABOB 
argues that, if owners of large station groups are allowed to purchase a newspaper, they will strengthen 
their competitive advantage over minority-owned radio stations, which tend to own one or two stations, in 
attracting advertisers seeking a volume discount.584  
196. As discussed above, we have declined to adopt the potential rule changes that 
commenters argue could lead to increased consolidation to the possible detriment of minority- and 
women-owned businesses.  Instead, the rule we adopt generally prohibits common ownership of a 
broadcast station and daily newspaper in the same local market but provides for a modest loosening of the 
previous ban on cross-ownership through revisions to the rule�s geographic scope, creation of an 
exception for failed/failing entities, and adoption of a viewpoint diversity-based waiver standard.  We do 
not believe that these modest revisions are likely to result in significant new combinations, nor does the 
record establish that there is significant demand for newspaper/broadcast combinations; indeed, the trend 
is in the opposite direction, as cross-owned combinations are being severed.585 Moreover, as discussed in 
the FNPRM, we find that the record fails to demonstrate that the modifications to the NBCO Rule that we 
adopt today are likely to result in harm to minority and female ownership.586 Additionally, the study that 
Free Press proposes, which would involve examining grandfathered combinations separately from waived 
combinations, would be unlikely to provide useful results given the small sample size available for each 
of those categories (Free Press�s own criticisms of the MMTC Cross-Ownership Study are instructive in 
this regard).587 Nor is such a study necessary in light of existing record evidence and the modest revisions 
we adopt today.  
197. Ultimately, while we adopt the revised NBCO Rule based on our viewpoint diversity 
goal, and not with the purpose of preserving or creating specific amounts of minority and female 
ownership, we find that this rule nevertheless helps to promote opportunities for diversity in broadcast 
television and radio ownership.  The rule helps to increase the likelihood of a variety of viewpoints and to 
preserve potential ownership opportunities for new voices.   
D. Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule
1. Introduction
198. The Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule prohibits an entity from owning more than 
two television stations and one radio station within the same market, unless the market meets the 
following size criteria.588 If at least 10 independently owned media voices would remain in the market 
post-merger, an entity may own up to two television stations and four radio stations.  If at least 20 
independently owned media voices would remain in the market post-merger, an entity may own either:

(1) two television stations and six radio stations, or (2) one television station and seven radio stations.  In 
all instances, entities also must comply with the local radio and local television ownership limits.  The 
market is determined by looking at the service contours of the relevant stations.589 The rule specifies how 
to count the number of media voices in a market, including television stations, radio stations, newspapers, 
and cable systems.590  
199. After consideration of the full record, including the further comments received in 
response to the FNPRM, we conclude that the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule continues to be 
necessary given that radio stations and television stations both contribute in meaningful ways to promote 
viewpoint diversity in local markets.  Our finding is consistent with the Commission�s decision in the 
2006 Quadrennial Review Order to retain the rule, which the Third Circuit upheld.591 In the NPRM and 
FNPRM, we asked whether the rule continues to serve the public interest by preserving viewpoint 
diversity in local markets or whether the local radio and television ownership rules alone would protect 
our goals adequately.592 We have concluded that the rule continues to play an independent role in serving 
the public interest separate and apart from the local radio and television ownership rules, which are 
designed primarily to promote competition.  Accordingly, given the important policy interests at stake, we 
will retain the cross-ownership rule in order to ensure that consumers continue to have access to a 
multiplicity of media voices.  
200. As detailed further below, we modify the rule only to the extent necessary to update its 
references to two analog television service contours that became obsolete with the transition to digital
television service.  First, consistent with our update to the NBCO Rule, we will use a television station�s 
digital PCC instead of its analog Grade A contour when determining the rule�s trigger.593 Second, we will 
use a television station�s digital NLSC instead of its analog Grade B contour when counting the number 
of media voices remaining in the market post-merger.594 We find that the benefits of retaining the rule 
(with minor contour modifications), outlined below, outweigh any burdens that may result from adopting 
the rule.
201. Finally, although the NPRM and FNPRM inquired whether eliminating the 
Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule would affect minority and female broadcast ownership,595 we 
have declined to eliminate the rule.  While we retain the rule in order to help promote viewpoint diversity, 
we find that retaining the rule is consistent with our goal of promoting minority and female ownership.

that competition also would benefit.596 The original rule prohibited ownership of more than one broadcast 
station in a market.597 In 1999, the Commission modified the rule to its current form.598 In the 2002 
Biennial Review Order, the Commission replaced the rule, among others, with a set of new cross-media 
limits that the Commission believed could protect viewpoint diversity more effectively than the existing 
rule.599 In Prometheus I, the Third Circuit rejected and remanded the cross-media limits, leaving in place 
the 1999 rule.600 Subsequently, the Commission retained that rule in the 2006 Quadrennial Review 
Order, finding that both radio and television contribute to the �marketplace of ideas� and thus add to the 
diversity of viewpoints.601 The Commission�s decision was based in part on the concern that the local 
radio and television ownership rules were insufficient to protect viewpoint diversity because those rules 
are primarily intended to protect competition.602 In Prometheus II, the Third Circuit upheld the 
Commission�s decision to retain the rule, finding that the Commission had provided a reasoned 
explanation for its conclusion that the rule is necessary to protect viewpoint diversity.603
203. The Commission tentatively concluded in the NPRM that, based on the record before it at 
the time, the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule is no longer necessary to promote the public 
interest.604 Consistent with past Commission findings, the NPRM tentatively concluded that the rule does 
not promote competition or localism.605 The NPRM also tentatively concluded that the rule is no longer 
necessary to promote viewpoint diversity.606 It pointed to media ownership studies suggesting that 
radio/television cross-ownership does not diminish the amount of local news available to consumers or 
the diversity of such programming.607 In addition, the NPRM posited that repeal of the rule would not 
lead to significant consolidation of broadcast facilities, at least within the largest markets, and it 
tentatively concluded that the local radio and television ownership rules adequately protect the 
Commission�s policy goals.608 The Commission sought comment on how the rule�s repeal might affect 
minority and female broadcast ownership.609 Finally, it explored how to update the rule, if retained, so 
that it would rely on digital, rather than analog, television contours.610

204. In the FNPRM, we sought further comment on the extent to which the Radio/Television
Cross-Ownership Rule promotes the public interest and asked commenters to submit any new evidence
relevant to our consideration of the rule�s costs and benefits.611 We encouraged commenters to quantify, 
to the greatest extent possible, these costs and benefits and the costs and benefits of any alternatives to the 
rule.612 We sought comment on evidence in the record at that time suggesting that radio stations are not 
primary outlets that contribute to viewpoint diversity and that consumers rely on newspapers and 
television stations as their principal sources of local news and information.613 We reiterated our tentative 
conclusions that the rule is not necessary to promote competition or to promote localism.614 We again 
invited commenters to submit evidence bearing on our view that repealing the rule would not have a 
significant impact on minority and female broadcast ownership.615
205. Several commenters urge the Commission to retain the Radio/Television Cross-
Ownership Rule.616 UCC et al. assert that further consolidation would disserve the public interest because 
radio stations provide diverse programming as well as a means of market entry for minority and women 
owners.617 According to UCC et al., radio is a healthy, vibrant medium on which consumers rely for news 
and information.618  They note that, according to the Radio Advertising Bureau, radio reaches 91.5 percent 
of Americans over 12 years old on a weekly basis, including 92 percent of African-American consumers 
and 93 percent of Hispanic consumers.619 As mentioned in the NBCO section above, UCC et al. cite 
surveys finding that 33 percent of adults listened to news on the radio �yesterday,� including 20 percent 
of young adults aged 18 through 24, and that 51 percent of people obtain local news on the radio at least 
once a week. 620 Also as discussed above, UCC et al. and NHMC claim that underserved communities in 
particular rely on radio as a source of local news and information.621 UCC et al. dispute the notion that 
the Commission�s local radio and television ownership rules are sufficient to constrain the harmful effects 
of consolidation.622 In addition, SAG-AFTRA claims that consolidation of broadcast station ownership 
reduces the number of jobs for media professionals, which results in fewer independent editorial 
perspectives in news coverage.623  
206. In response, Morris discounts the findings that UCC et al. cite, arguing that those studies 
also show that radio has become a less important source of local news in the past decade and that it places

fourth behind television, newspapers, and the Internet as a breaking news source.624 Morris additionally 
points to a study showing that most Latinos use two or three news media platforms on a typical weekday, 
underscoring that consumers have come to rely on an assortment of media to serve their information 
needs and are exposed to a diverse range of viewpoints on any given topic.625 NAB argues that the 
Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule should be eliminated because it does not promote competition or 
diversity and because it affirmatively harms localism.626 NAB also asserts that many Commission studies 
have concluded that cross-owned radio/television combinations produce greater amounts of news and 
public affairs programming.627 In addition, NAB agrees with the proposition that radio stations are not the 
primary outlets contributing to viewpoint diversity.628  
3. Discussion
207. We conclude that the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule should be retained 
because, as discussed above in the context of the NBCO Rule, we find that radio stations are meaningful 
contributors to viewpoint diversity within their communities.629 We find that broadcast radio and 
television stations are valuable mediums for viewpoint expression such that losing a distinct voice 
through additional consolidation could disserve the public interest.  We recognize that the current rule 
permits a degree of common ownership, especially in larger markets, but that latitude is not a sufficient 
reason to ignore the potential harms to viewpoint diversity that may result from further consolidation.  We
believe that there is a significant risk of harm in potentially reducing the number of �diverse and 
antagonistic� information sources within a market.630 Therefore, we retain the Radio/Television Cross-
Ownership Rule, with modifications limited to updating its obsolete references to analog television 
service contours, in order to protect viewpoint diversity in local markets.631  
208. Retaining the Rule.  As discussed above in the context of the NBCO Rule, while 
broadcast television stations and newspapers may be the primary sources of viewpoint diversity in local 
markets, the current record shows that broadcast radio contributes to viewpoint diversity in meaningful 
ways.632 For example, by providing an over-the-air forum for live, interactive discussion and expression 
of viewpoint on matters of local concern, radio offers added opportunities for public participation and 
civic engagement.633 Commenters that support retention of the cross-ownership restriction provide new 
evidence of radio�s contributions to viewpoint diversity with examples of radio programming containing 
local news and public affairs content and with data showing that consumers regularly turn to radio for

631 Consistent with our analysis in the NBCO context, we find that Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule is not 
necessary to promote competition or localism in local markets.  In the FNPRM, we recognized that cross-ownership 
can create efficiencies that may result in public interest benefits, such as localism.  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4469, 
para. 221.  However, there is no guarantee that owners will use any gains produced by such efficiencies to benefit 
consumers, for example, by increasing investment in local news production.

news and information.634 Moreover, platforms such as the Internet or cable do not contribute significantly 
to viewpoint diversity in local markets and therefore do not meaningfully protect against the potential loss 
of viewpoint diversity that would result from increased radio/television cross-ownership.635 We are 
cognizant of the fact that consumers� reliance on radio for local news and information has declined over 
time, as has the number of all-news commercial radio stations.636 Nonetheless, we find that it would be 
inconsistent with our goal of preserving viewpoint diversity to rescind the Radio/Television Cross-
Ownership Rule and allow greater consolidation to diminish the viewpoint diversity available in local 
markets.  
209. As acknowledged in the FNPRM, the existing rule already permits various levels of 
cross-ownership, based on the size of the market.637 As the Commission has found previously, however, 
the existing limits strike an appropriate balance between the protection of viewpoint diversity and the 
potential public interest benefits that could result from the efficiencies gained by common ownership of 
radio and television stations in a local market.638 While relying solely on the local television and local 
radio ownership rules, each designed to promote competition, might result in only limited additional 
consolidation, there would still be a loss to viewpoint diversity if the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership 
Rule were eliminated.639 As UCC et al. and NHMC show, a significant percentage of consumers, 
particularly in underserved communities, regularly obtain at least some of their local news and 
information from radio.640 And although we continue to find that, in general, newspapers and television 
stations are the main sources that consumers turn to for local news and information, and the Commission 
previously has held that radio generally plays a lesser role in contributing to viewpoint diversity,641 we 
nevertheless conclude that radio contributes meaningfully to viewpoint diversity.  The record shows that 
broadcast television and radio are both important sources of viewpoint diversity in local markets; 
accordingly, we find that the public interest is best served by retaining the existing rule in order to protect 
viewpoint diversity in these markets.642

Owned Radio Stations); NHMC FNPRM Comments at 6-11.

636 See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4467, para. 215 (�The number of people who listen to some news on the radio

all-news radio stations, a reduction from 50 in the mid-1980s.�) (internal citations omitted).  As discussed above, 
while broadcast radio stations have historically been a less significant source of viewpoint diversity than newspapers 
and broadcast television stations, the Commission has still been justified in its efforts to regulate cross-ownership.   
See supra para. 154.
637 We sought comment in the FNPRM on the extent to which the rule constrains consolidation beyond what is 
permitted under the local television and local radio ownership rules and whether those rules would be sufficient to 
protect our policy goals absent the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule.  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4467-68, 
paras. 216-17; see also NPRM, 26 FCC Rcd at 17535-36, para. 126.  We tentatively concluded that eliminating the 
rule would have no effect on the number of television stations an entity could own in a market and would permit the 
acquisition of only one or two additional radio stations in large markets.  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4467-68, paras.

radio�s contributions to viewpoint diversity are significant enough to warrant the rule�s retention.  Rather,

210. Finally, the Commission asked in the NPRM how the results of Media Ownership Studies 
8A and 8B, which found little to no correlation between radio/television cross-ownership and viewpoint 
diversity, should inform its analysis.643 As we explained in the FNPRM, Media Ownership Study 8A 
analyzes the impact of radio/television cross-ownership on viewpoint diversity available in local markets 
by examining how consumers react to content.644 Media Ownership Study 8B examines the impact of 
media ownership, including radio/television cross-ownership, on the amount of programming provided in 
television news programs in three categories:  politics, local programming, and diversity in coverage of 
news topics.645 We did not receive meaningful comment on how the results of these studies should inform 
our analysis.  Based on our review, these studies provide some evidence that common ownership does not 
always limit viewpoint diversity.646 We find, however, that the conclusions in these studies are too 
limited to serve as a basis for a rule change.647 Ultimately, while the studies do present interesting 
findings based on indirect means of measuring viewpoint diversity, we do not find that the results�
standing in contrast to the record evidence demonstrating the importance of broadcast radio and television 
stations to viewpoint diversity in local markets�justify elimination of the Radio/Television Cross-
Ownership Rule.   
211. Contour Modifications.  In the NPRM, the Commission sought comment on how the 
Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule could be modified to account for the fact that the analog 
broadcast television contours upon which the rule relies became obsolete with the transition to digital 
television service.648 The Commission observed that the digital NLSC approximates the Grade B contour 
but that the Grade A contour does not have a digital equivalent.649 Given that we are retaining the rule 
and did not receive any comments on this issue in the context of this rule, we will draw from the relevant 
discussions and comments in the context of other rules to make the modifications necessary to update the 
Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule.  
212. The first of these modifications updates the television contour used to determine when 
the rule is triggered.  The digital PCC, as defined in Section 73.625 of the Commission�s rules, will 
replace the analog Grade A contour when assessing whether a television station�s contour encompasses a 
radio station�s community of license.650 This change is consistent with our replacement of the Grade A

646 The Commission already has recognized that there is some evidence that cross-ownership does not always limit 
viewpoint diversity.  However, the Commission also has found that the possibility of a connection between 
ownership and viewpoint is not disproved by evidence that a connection is not always present.  Indeed, the 
Commission has noted previously the existence of ample evidence that ownership can affect viewpoint.  As noted in 
the context of the NBCO Rule, we believe the best way to promote viewpoint diversity is by maximizing the number 
of independently owned stations in a market, not by relying on a hope or expectation that cross-owned properties 
will maintain distinct voices.  See supra para. 144.  
647 The authors of Media Ownership Study 8A caution that their evidence �does not provide any conclusive basis for 
policymaking,� that they do not make �any claims of causality,� and that their findings are based on limited data.  
Media Ownership Study 8A, as revised, at 22-23.  The authors of Media Ownership Study 8B, while forming more 
detailed conclusions than in Media Ownership Study 8A, concede that they were �forced to rely on limited variation

interest.�  Media Ownership Study 8B, as revised, at 18-19.

contour for purposes of the NBCO Rule.651 Additionally, as we stated in the FNPRM, a television 
station�s PCC ensures reliable service for the community of license, is already defined in the 
Commission�s rules, and can be verified easily in the event of a dispute.652  
213. The second modification updates the use of a television station�s Grade B contour for 
purposes of determining how many media voices would remain in a market following a station 
acquisition.  A television station�s digital NLSC, the digital approximate of the Grade B contour, will 
replace that analog measurement.653 Therefore, we will count as media voices those independently owned 
and operating full-power broadcast television stations within the DMA of the television station�s (or 
stations�) community (or communities) of license that have digital NLSCs that overlap with the digital 
NLSC(s) of the television station(s) at issue.654 This digital NLSC substitution is consistent with our 
replacement of the Grade B contour in the Local Television Ownership Rule.655  
214. Grandfathering.  Due to the contour modifications we adopt herein, there may be 
circumstances in which an existing combination now will be impermissible under the revised rule.656 For 
example, because the PCC is slightly larger than the previous analog Grade A contour, combinations that 
previously were permissible under the rule may now violate the ownership limits.  Consistent with our 
approach in adopting technical modifications to the Local Television Ownership Rule and the NBCO 
Rule, we will grandfather any existing combinations, so long as they are held by their current owners, in 
order to avoid imposing the hardship of divestiture on owners previously compliant with the rules.  
However, subsequent purchasers must either comply with the rule in effect at that time or obtain a 
waiver.657  
215. Minority and Female Ownership.  The FNPRM and NPRM asked whether repealing the 
Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule would have an effect on minority and female broadcast 
ownership.658 In the FNPRM, we noted that we did not believe that there was evidence in the record to 
suggest that eliminating the rule would harm minority and female ownership or that the rule has protected 
or promoted minority or female ownership.659 In response to the FNPRM, UCC et al. argue that 
permitting further consolidation would disserve the public interest because radio provides one of the few 
entry points into media ownership for minorities and women.660 No commenters dispute that radio is a 
key entry point for minority and female ownership in the broadcast industry.  While we retain the existing 
Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule (with minor contour modifications) based on our viewpoint 
diversity goal, and not with the purpose of preserving or creating specific amounts of minority and female

657 Thus, stations that are subject to license assignment or transfer of control applications will be required to comply 
with the applicable rules, except that grandfathering will continue to apply to stations that are subject to pro forma
changes in ownership and involuntary changes of ownership due to death or legal disability of the licensee.  See

ownership, we find that retaining the existing rule nevertheless helps to promote opportunities for
diversity in broadcast television and radio ownership.  The rule helps to increase the likelihood of a 
variety of viewpoints and to preserve ownership opportunities for new entrants.
E. Dual Network Rule
1. Introduction
216. Based on the record compiled in the 2010 and 2014 Quadrennial Review proceedings, we 
find that the Dual Network Rule, which permits common ownership of multiple broadcast networks but 
prohibits a merger between or among the �top-four� networks (specifically, ABC, CBS, Fox, and 
NBC),661 continues to be necessary to promote competition and localism and should be retained without 
modification.662  We find that, in comparison to other broadcast and cable networks, the top-four 
broadcast television networks have a distinctive ability to attract larger primetime audiences on a regular 
basis, which enables the top-four networks to earn higher rates from those advertisers seeking to reach 
large, national mass audiences consistently.  By reducing the number of choices available to such 
advertisers, a combination among top-four broadcast networks could substantially lessen competition and 
lead the networks to pay less attention to viewer demand for innovative, high-quality programming.  We 
also find that the Dual Network Rule remains necessary to preserve the ability of affiliates to influence 
network decisions in a manner that best serves the interests of their local communities, thereby 
maintaining the balance of bargaining power between the top-four networks and their affiliates.  We 
conclude that the benefits of retaining the rule outweigh any potential burdens.
2. Background
217. In the FNPRM, we tentatively concluded that the Dual Network Rule should be retained 
in order to promote competition and localism.663 We sought comment on these tentative findings and 
invited commenters to augment the record with any new or different evidence, data, or information 
relevant to our consideration of the rule.664  
218. No new comments were filed in response to the FNPRM advocating the repeal of the 
Dual Network Rule.  However, CBS and Fox resubmitted their earlier comments filed in response to the 
NPRM, in which CBS and Fox each argued that the Dual Network Rule should be repealed.665 According 
to CBS, developments in the television marketplace have undermined the original rationales for the rule, 
and the Commission is no longer justified in singling out the top-four broadcast networks for disparate 
treatment vis-�-vis cable networks.666 CBS stated that in recent years cable networks have modified their 
programming lineups to include more programming of the sort that, in the past, has aired primarily on 
broadcast networks (e.g., original scripted dramas and sitcoms, national and local news, and sports 
  
661 The rule provides that �[a] television broadcast station may affiliate with a person or entity that maintains two or 
more networks of television broadcast stations unless such dual or multiple networks are composed of two or more 
persons or entities that, on February 8, 1996, were �networks� as defined in [Section] 73.3613(a)(1) of the 
Commission�s regulations . . . .�  47 CFR � 73.658(g) (emphasis in original).

programming).667 CBS noted that, under the Commission�s rules, �one entity can own an unlimited 
number of these cable networks . . . but cannot own even two of the four broadcast networks named in the 
Dual Network Rule, even if those networks are not the most-watched.�668 Fox questions the basis for the 
Dual Network Rule in today�s media environment, asserting that a merger between two networks would 
not harm localism, diversity, or, absent a violation of antitrust laws, competition.669  
219. By contrast, several parties submitted comments in response to the FNPRM supporting 
our tentative conclusion to retain the Dual Network Rule.670 WGAW states that the rule remains 
necessary to promote competition in the market for primetime programming.671 WGAW notes that 
broadcast networks are increasingly airing programming produced by affiliated studios, with content 
produced by an affiliated studio comprising between 45 percent and 59 percent of the series airing on 
each of the top-four networks during the 2012-2013 season.672 WGAW argues that any merger between 
the top national networks would place more content under common control, which would harm 
competition and limit consumer choice.673  
220. Furthermore, the CBS Television Network Affiliates Association (CBS Affiliates) and 
the NBC Television Affiliates (NBC Affiliates) argue that the Dual Network Rule remains necessary to 
promote localism.674 They argue that the rule maintains the balance between the networks and their 
affiliates, which in turn protects the independent discretion of local affiliates to make programming 
decisions.675 These commenters state that local network affiliates promote localism through the provision 
of complementary local programming, such as local news, sports, weather, and public information 
programming.676 According to these commenters, the loss of an independent top-four network would 
reduce the bargaining power that local affiliates have with the networks, which would harm the affiliates� 
ability to serve their local markets.677 The CBS Affiliates are also concerned that consolidation between 
top-four networks could harm competition by discouraging networks from bidding on or investing in 
more regional and national sports programs, which may in turn result in such programming migrating 
away from free, over-the-air television.678 Furthermore, the NBC Affiliates assert that the potential 
negative impacts of a top-four network merger would be exacerbated in light of the recent horizontal and 
vertical integration involving MVPDs and content providers.679

3. Discussion
221. Competition.  We conclude that the Dual Network Rule continues to be necessary in the 
public interest to foster competition in the provision of primetime entertainment programming and the 
sale of national advertising time.  As discussed in more detail below, we find that the primetime 
entertainment programming supplied by the top-four broadcast networks is a distinct product and that the 
provision of this programming could be restricted if two or more of the top-four networks were to merge.  
We continue to believe that at present these four major networks continue to constitute a �strategic group� 
in the national advertising marketplace and compete largely among themselves for advertisers that seek to 
reach comparatively large, national audiences.  Accordingly, we find that a top-four network merger 
would substantially lessen competition for advertising dollars in the national advertising marketplace, 
which would, in turn, reduce incentives for the networks to compete with each other for viewers by 
providing innovative, high-quality programming.  Based on their distinctive characteristics relative to 
other broadcast and cable networks, we conclude that the top-four broadcast networks continue to serve a 
unique role in the provision of primetime entertainment programming and the sale of national advertising 
time that justifies the retention of this rule specific to them.
222. We find that the top-four broadcast networks continue to attract primetime audiences that 
are more consistent and larger than those achieved by other broadcast or cable networks, as measured 
both by the audience size for individual programs and by the audience size for each network as a whole.  
The primetime entertainment programming supplied by the top-four broadcast networks generally is 
designed to appeal to a mass audience, and financing such programming on the scale needed for a 
consistent primetime lineup, in turn, requires investment of substantial revenues that only a consistently 
large, mass audience can provide.  Thus, the primetime entertainment programming that the top-four 
networks provide to their affiliated local stations is intended to attract on a regular basis both mass 
audiences and the advertisers that want to reach them.  This is in contrast to other broadcast networks, and 
many cable networks, which tend to target more specialized, niche audiences.680  
223. We note that in recent years some cable networks may have modified their primetime 
lineups to more closely resemble those of broadcast networks681 and that some online video providers 
have started offering original programming that may also attract sizable audiences.  Nonetheless, at this 
time we do not believe that cable networks or online providers have assembled a platform of 
programming that is consistently of the same broad appeal and audience share, on the whole, as the 
primetime entertainment programming provided by the top-four broadcast networks.  
224. Although, as discussed further below, certain individual cable primetime entertainment 
programs have managed to achieve audiences of a size that is comparable to those achieved regularly by 
their broadcast network counterparts,682 we continue to believe that the ability of the top-four broadcast 
networks to attract consistent, large primetime audiences remains unmatched by that of any other 
broadcast or cable network.  In the FNPRM, we noted that, while the highest-rated cable primetime 
entertainment programs in 2011 attracted between 8 and 9 million viewers at most, there were typically a

34.  See Univision Communications Inc., Univision � The #1 place to reach Hispanic America,

WarnerBros.com � The Studio, http://www.warnerbros.com/studio/divisions/television/cw-television-network (last 
visited June 8, 2016).  Due to their targeted approaches, programming on these networks attracts smaller audiences 
than the top-four networks.  For example, during the 2014-2015 broadcast television season, the highest-rated 
broadcast program that aired on a non-top-four network was The Flash on the CW, which ranked 109th among 
primetime programs airing on broadcast networks during the 2014-2015 season.  FCC staff analysis of broadcast 
television ratings data from Nielsen.  Ratings data are for total viewers (live plus DVR viewing within seven days).

dozen or more primetime entertainment programs on the top-four broadcast networks that attracted more 
than 10 million viewers during any given week of the 2010-2011 television season.683 We noted that the 
highest-rated broadcast programs frequently attracted more than 20 million viewers, based on Nielsen 
data.684  
225. More recent data show that, while certain cable networks have continued to air a discrete 
number of individual programs or episodes that have become increasingly capable of attracting primetime 
audiences on par with, or even greater than, the top-four broadcast networks, no one cable network�let 
alone several�has been able to consistently deliver such audiences beyond individual programs or 
episodes.   For instance, during 2015, The Walking Dead on AMC attracted between 12 and 16 million 
primetime viewers per episode, placing it among the 20 most-watched primetime entertainment programs 
on broadcast and cable during the weeks that it aired on the cable network.685 Other popular primetime 
entertainment programs on cable networks, such as Game of Thrones on HBO and Fear the Walking 
Dead on AMC, attracted between 7 and 11 million viewers for their highest-rated episodes and placed 
among the 20 most-watched primetime entertainment programs on broadcast and cable during some 
weeks but not others.686 Besides these few individual series or episodes, however, the highest-rated 
primetime entertainment programs on cable networks attracted, at most, between 6 and 7 million viewers, 
with one exception.687 By contrast, for most of 2015 there were, at minimum, a dozen�and in a number 
of weeks around two dozen or so�primetime entertainment programs on the top-four broadcast networks 
that attracted more than 7 million viewers, with some of the highest-rated episodes attracting between 18 
and 26 million viewers.688 Moreover, during any given week in 2015, primetime entertainment programs 
on the top-four broadcast networks accounted for nearly all�if not all�of the 20 most watched 
primetime entertainment programs on broadcast and cable networks, based on total viewership.689 These 
data indicate that primetime entertainment programs on the top-four broadcast networks have continued 
to attract audiences that are larger and more consistent than those attracted by primetime entertainment 
programs on other broadcast and cable networks.
226. This conclusion is also supported by data on the average primetime audience size of 
individual broadcast and cable networks, as measured at the network level.  Even though an increasing 
number of individual cable primetime entertainment programs or episodes have achieved audiences of a 
similar size to their broadcast network counterparts, on average the primetime audience size for each of 
the top-four broadcast networks has remained significantly larger than the audience size for even the most 
popular cable networks.  In 2011, the average primetime audience for a top-four broadcast network was

more than three times larger than the average primetime audience of the highest-rated non-sports cable 
networks and more than five times larger than that of the next-highest rated English-language broadcast 
network, based on Commission staff analysis of data from SNL Kagan.690 Based on staff analysis of more 
recent data from 2014, we find that there continues to be a significant gap in size between the average 
primetime audience of the top-four broadcast networks and that of other broadcast or cable networks.  
During 2014, the average primetime audience for a top-four broadcast network was approximately three 
and a half times larger than the average primetime audience for the highest-rated non-sports cable 
networks and nearly four times larger than that of the next-highest rated English-language broadcast 
network, based on staff analysis of data from SNL Kagan.691 Accordingly, we conclude that the 
primetime entertainment programming provided by the top-four broadcast networks continues to be a 
distinct product capable of attracting large audiences of a size that individual cable networks cannot 
  
690 In 2011, the top-four broadcast networks had an average primetime audience of approximately 5.11 million 
households, compared to approximately 1.70 million for the four highest-rated non-sports cable networks (USA, 
Disney Channel, TNT, and Nickelodeon/Nick At Nite).  Staff calculated an average for the top-four networks by 
adding together the average primetime audience of each of the four networks in the group and then dividing the total 
by four.  Univision, a Spanish-language network, was the fifth-highest rated broadcast network, with an average 
primetime audience of approximately 1.92 million households during 2011, or less than half the size of the average 
primetime audience of the top-four broadcast networks and less than half the size of the average primetime audience 
of the lowest-rated top-four broadcast network, which was NBC at approximately 4.26 million.  The next-highest 
rated English-language broadcast network was the CW, which ranked sixth overall, with an average primetime 
audience of approximately 0.94 million households.  See SNL Kagan, TV Network Summary, Broadcast Networks 
by Average Prime Time TVHH Delivery (000) as of June 8, 2016 (SNL Kagan Broadcast Networks by Average 
Prime Time TVHH Delivery June 8, 2016); SNL Kagan, TV Network Summary, Basic Cable Networks by Average 
Prime Time TVHH Delivery (000) as of June 8, 2016 (SNL Kagan Basic Cable Networks by Average Prime Time 
TVHH Delivery June 8, 2016).  We find that it is appropriate, for purposes of the Dual Network Rule, to exclude all-
sports networks, such as ESPN, from our review of network primetime viewership data, advertising prices, and 
advertising revenue, because we believe that the focus of these networks (i.e., live sports and other sports-related 
programming) distinguishes them from other broadcast and cable networks.  Even if we included all-sports networks 
in our review, however, these networks would not have a significant impact on our analysis such that we would 
reach different conclusions.  
691 See SNL Kagan Broadcast Networks by Average Prime Time TVHH Delivery June 8, 2016; SNL Kagan Basic 
Cable Networks by Average Prime Time TVHH Delivery June 8, 2016.  In 2014, the top-four broadcast networks 
had an average primetime audience of approximately 4.69 million households, compared to approximately 1.34 
million for the four highest-rated non-sports cable networks (USA, Disney Channel, TNT, and TBS).  Staff 
calculated an average for the top-four networks by adding together the average primetime audience of each of the 
four networks in the group and then dividing the total by four.  The fifth-highest rated broadcast network, Univision, 
had an average primetime audience of 1.64 million households, or less than half the size of the average primetime 
audience of the top-four broadcast networks and less than half the size of the average primetime audience of the 
lowest-rated top-four broadcast network, which was Fox at approximately 3.45 million.  The next-highest rated 
English-language broadcast network was the CW, which ranked sixth overall, with an average primetime audience 
of approximately 0.99 million households.
Another way to examine the difference in ratings between the top-four broadcast networks and cable networks is to 
look at the gap between the lowest-rated top-four broadcast network and the highest-rated non-sports cable network, 
which also increased between 2011 to 2014.  In 2011, the average primetime audience of the lowest-rated top-four 
broadcast network (NBC) was nearly 4.26 million households, as stated above, while the average primetime 
audience of the highest-rated non-sports cable network (USA Network, which is owned by NBCUniversal) was 
approximately 2.15 million households, or approximately half the size of NBC�s audience.  In 2014, the average 
primetime audience for the lowest-rated top-four broadcast network (Fox) was approximately 3.45 million 
households, as stated above, while the average primetime audience of the highest-rated non-sports cable network 
(USA Network) was approximately 1.42 million, or less than half the size of Fox�s audience.  SNL Kagan Broadcast

consistently replicate, despite the ability of a few primetime cable network programs to achieve similarly 
large audiences on an individual basis.   
227. In addition, there continues to be a wide disparity in the advertising rates earned by the 
top-four broadcast networks and the advertising rates charged by other broadcast and cable networks, 
which further indicates that the top-four broadcast networks are distinct from other networks.  In the 
NPRM, the Commission noted that based on data for 2009, the top-four broadcast networks generally 
earned higher advertising rates than cable networks,692 and we find that this disparity continues to exist, as 
shown by more recent data.  For instance, based on staff analysis of SNL Kagan data for 2011, the 
average advertising rate among the top-four broadcast networks, as estimated in cost per thousand views 
(referred to as cost per mille or CPM), was approximately $19.19.693 By contrast, the four highest CPMs 
among non-sports cable networks for the same period (MTV, Bravo, Discovery Channel, and TBS) had 
an average of approximately $10.95, or approximately 43 percent less than that of the top-four broadcast 
networks.694 This gap grew slightly between 2011 and 2014, when the average of the four highest CPMs 
among non-sports cable networks (MTV, Bravo, Discovery Channel, and Food Network) was 
approximately $12.43,695 or approximately 44 percent less than the average CPM among the top-four 
broadcast networks, which was approximately $22.31.696  
228. Data on net advertising revenues provide further indication that the top-four broadcast 
networks are particularly appealing to advertisers seeking consistent, large national audiences.  As noted 
in the FNPRM, in 2011, the top-four broadcast networks averaged approximately $3.17 billion in net 
advertising revenues, based on Commission staff analysis of data from SNL Kagan.697 By contrast, the 
four non-sports cable networks with the highest net advertising revenue totals (Nickelodeon, USA 
Network, TNT, and MTV) averaged just under $1 billion in estimated net advertising revenues, or less 
than a third of the average amount that the top-four broadcast networks are estimated to have received.698  
This gap between the net advertising revenue generated by the highest-earning cable networks and those 
generated by the top-four broadcast networks persists.  In 2014, the four non-sports cable networks with 
the highest net advertising revenue totals (TNT, USA, TBS, and Nickelodeon/Nick At Nite) averaged

We note that Fox has a more limited schedule of programming, which reduces its total advertising revenues.

approximately $1.07 billion in estimated net advertising revenues, or less than a third of the average 
amount that the top-four broadcast networks are estimated to have received, which is $3.46 billion.699  
These four cable networks are projected to have received the highest net advertising revenues in 2015 as 
well, averaging approximately $1.04 billion in estimated net advertising revenues, or less than a third of 
the average amount that the top-four broadcast networks are projected to have received, which is $3.31 
billion.700 We find that these data further support our conclusion that the top-four broadcast networks 
comprise a strategic group in the national advertising marketplace and compete largely among themselves 
for advertisers that seek to reach large, national mass audiences consistently. 
229. Therefore, we retain the existing Dual Network Rule without modification in order to 
promote competition in the sale of national advertising time.  We also agree with WGAW that the rule 
remains necessary to promote competition in the marketplace for primetime programming.701  
Specifically, we find that the top-four broadcast networks have a distinctive ability to attract, on a regular 
basis, larger primetime audiences than other broadcast and cable networks, which enables them to earn 
higher rates from those advertisers that are willing to pay a premium for such audiences.  Thus, a 
combination between two top-four broadcast networks would reduce the choices available to advertisers 
seeking large, national audiences, which could substantially lessen competition and lead the networks to 
pay less attention to viewer demand for innovative, high-quality programming.  We therefore conclude 
that the primetime entertainment programming provided by the top-four broadcast networks and national 
television advertising time are each distinct products�the availability, price, and quality of which could 
be restricted, to the detriment of consumers, if two of the top-four networks were permitted to merge.702

2014, with approximately $2.72 billion in estimated net advertising revenues.  Again, we note that Fox has a more 
limited schedule of programming, which reduces its total advertising revenues.  Additionally, in 2014 Univision 
ranked fifth among broadcast networks, with approximately $0.78 billion in estimated net advertising revenues; 
Telemundo ranked sixth, with approximately $0.45 billion; and the CW network ranked seventh, with approximately 
$0.40 billion.  See SNL Kagan Broadcast Networks by Net Advertising Revenue June 8, 2016.  As we note above,

Commission consider other measures, in addition to the Dual Network Rule, to limit the amount of primetime

as a result of the repeal of the Commission�s former financial interest and syndication (fin/syn) rules, the top-four

affiliates.  Id. at 6-8.  The Commission�s former fin/syn rules, which limited the amount of programming in

on this issue, we note that the audience size for each of the three broadcast network evening newscasts (ABC, CBS, 
and NBC) further distinguishes these networks from other cable and broadcast networks.  For instance, during 2011, 
more than four times as many people watched the three broadcast network evening newscasts than watched the

Accordingly, we conclude that the Dual Network Rule remains necessary to foster competition in the sale 
of national television advertising time and the provision of primetime entertainment programming.703  
230. Localism.  In addition to furthering the Commission�s competition goal, we conclude 
that, consistent with past Commission findings, the Dual Network Rule also continues to be necessary to 
foster localism.704 Specifically, we find that eliminating the rule could increase the bargaining power of 
the top-four broadcast networks over their affiliate stations, thereby reducing the ability of the affiliates to 
influence network programming decisions in a manner that best serves the interests of their local 
communities.  Typically, a critical role of a broadcast network is to provide its local affiliate stations with 
high-quality programming.705 Because this programming is distributed nationwide, broadcast networks 
have an economic incentive to ensure that the programming both appeals to a mass, nationwide audience
and is widely shown by affiliate stations.  By contrast, a network�s local affiliate stations provide local 
input on network programming decisions and air programming that serves the specific needs and interests 
of that specific local community.  As a result, the economic incentives of the networks are not always 
aligned with the interests of the local affiliate stations or the communities they serve.  
231. In the context of this complementary network-affiliate relationship, we agree with the 
CBS Affiliates and the NBC Affiliates that a top-four network merger would reduce the ability of a 
network affiliate station to use the availability of other top, independently owned networks as a 
bargaining tool to exert influence on the programming decisions of its network,706 including the affiliate�s 
ability to engage in a dialogue with its network over the suitability for local audiences of either the 
content or scheduling of network programming.  Elimination of the Dual Network Rule would increase 
the economic leverage of the top-four networks over their affiliate stations, which would harm localism 
by diminishing the ability of the affiliates to serve their communities.707 The Commission has recognized 
that affiliate stations play an important role in assuring that the needs and tastes of local viewers are 
served.708 We also agree with the ABC Television Affiliates Association, CBS Television Network 
Affiliates Association, and NBC Television Affiliates (collectively, Affiliates Associations) that the Dual 
Network Rule is �an important structural principle� that helps to maintain equilibrium between the top-

four networks and their affiliate stations.709 Accordingly, we conclude that the Dual Network Rule 
remains necessary to foster localism.710
232. Dual Affiliation.  As noted previously, some commenters have urged the Commission to 
prohibit a TV station from affiliating with two or more top-four broadcast networks in a single market, 
claiming that dual affiliation allows a broadcaster to �do locally what the networks are forbidden from 
doing nationally,� which is to consolidate the bargaining power of multiple top-four network signals 
under the control of a single entity.711 We agree with Fox, however, that dual affiliation does not 
implicate the Dual Network Rule and that the rule should not be expanded to address dual affiliation 
practices.712 The Dual Network Rule addresses harms to competition and localism that would result from 
a decrease in the number of networks competing for national advertisers and the reduced ability of local
affiliate stations to use the availability of other top, independently owned networks as a bargaining tool to 
influence network programming decisions.  Because dual affiliation does not reduce the number of 
network owners, we believe that dual affiliation does not give rise to either of these harms.713  
Accordingly, arguments related to dual affiliation are not relevant to our consideration of the Dual 
Network Rule.  We believe that these issues are more relevant to the Local Television Ownership Rule, 
and we address them above in that context.714  
233. Minority and Female Ownership.  In this proceeding, we sought comment on the impact 
of our media ownership rules on minority and female ownership of broadcast stations.715 No commenters, 
however, addressed the potential impact of the Dual Network Rule on minority and female ownership.  
Given the distinct nature of the Dual Network Rule and its focus on mergers involving the top-four 
broadcast networks, and not ownership limits in local markets, we do not believe that this rule would be 
expected to have any meaningful impact on minority and female ownership levels.  
IV. DIVERSITY ORDER REMAND
234. In addition to assessing each of our broadcast ownership rules subject to quadrennial 
review pursuant to Section 202(h), we are considering in this proceeding the Third Circuit�s remand of 
the Commission�s 2008 Diversity Order, in particular the decision in that order to adopt a revenue-based 
eligible entity definition as a race-neutral means of facilitating ownership diversity.  In Prometheus II, the 
Third Circuit held that the Commission�s decision to adopt the revenue-based definition was arbitrary and 
capricious because the Commission did not show how such a definition specifically would assist 
minorities and women, who were among the stated intended beneficiaries of that action.716 In light of this 
  
709 See Affiliates Associations NPRM Comments at 2.
710 In the NPRM, the Commission also sought comment on whether antitrust laws and our public interest standard 
are sufficient to address any harms to competition or localism that might result from a top-four network merger.  See 
NPRM, 26 FCC Rcd at 17543-44, paras. 144, 146.  As discussed above, our concern here is that a merger of two or 
more top-four networks would restrict the availability, price, and quality of primetime entertainment programming 
and the bargaining power and influence of network affiliate stations, harming consumers and localism.  Because 
these harms to consumers and localism are not typically considered in a structural antitrust analysis, we do not 
believe that antitrust enforcement would adequately protect against these harms.  See 2006 Quadrennial Review 
Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2083, para. 141, n.451 (finding that antitrust enforcement would not protect against certain 
harms addressed by the Dual Network Rule:  �reduce[d] program output, choices, quality, and innovation to the 
detriment of viewers, and with reduced affiliate power and influence�).

conclusion, the Third Circuit remanded each of the measures that relied on the revenue-based eligible 
entity definition the Commission adopted in the Diversity Order.717 The court also instructed the 
Commission to consider the other eligible entity definitions that the Commission discussed in the Third 
Diversity FNPRM accompanying the Diversity Order, including a proposal based on the socially 
disadvantaged business (SDB) definition employed by the Small Business Administration (SBA).718 The 
NPRM sought comment on how the Commission should respond to the court�s remand and on other 
actions that the Commission should consider to enhance the diversity of ownership in the broadcast 
industry, including minority and female ownership of broadcast stations.719 The FNPRM offered tentative 
conclusions in response to the court�s remand and sought comment on whether any of those conclusions 
should be reconsidered based on additional or new information in the context of the 2014 Quadrennial 
Review.720 In Prometheus III, the Third Circuit ordered the Commission �to act promptly to bring the 
eligible entity definition to a close� by �mak[ing] a final determination as to whether to adopt a new 
definition.�721
235. We discuss below the actions that we believe are appropriate in response to the Third 
Circuit�s remand of the Diversity Order.  As a threshold matter, we discuss the Commission�s ongoing 
initiatives to promote diversity of ownership among broadcast licensees and to expand opportunities for 
minorities and women to participate in the broadcast industry.  We also discuss the Commission�s 
ongoing improvements to the collection of data and other empirical evidence that are relevant to minority 
and female ownership issues.  We next discuss the measures we are adopting today to enhance ownership 
diversity.  Based on the record in this proceeding, the Third Circuit�s remand instructions, and our 
analysis of the preexisting eligible entity standard and the measures to which it applied, we conclude that 
we should reinstate the revenue-based eligible entity standard and apply it to the regulatory policies set 
forth in the Diversity Order.  We conclude that reinstating the previous revenue-based standard will serve 
the public interest by promoting small business participation in the broadcast industry and potential entry 
by new entrepreneurs.  We find that small businesses benefit from flexible licensing policies and that 
easing certain regulations for small business applicants and licensees will encourage innovation and 
enhance viewpoint diversity.  We also believe that the benefits of reinstating the eligible entity standard 
and applying it to the regulatory measures set forth in the Diversity Order outweigh any potential costs of 
our decision to do so.  Accordingly, we conclude that this action will advance the policy objectives that 
traditionally have guided the Commission�s analyses of broadcast ownership issues.  
236. This action does not, of course, preclude our consideration of other or additional 
eligibility standards that have been put forward as means to promote minority and women ownership of 
broadcast stations.  As discussed further below, we decline to adopt an SDB eligibility standard, which 
expressly would recognize the race and ethnicity of applicants, or any other race- or gender-conscious 
measure in this proceeding.  We have carefully studied the record, and the evidence does not establish a 
basis for race-conscious remedies.  Thus, we do not believe that such measures would withstand review 
under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.722 Finally, we 
evaluate additional measures that commenters have proposed as potential means of promoting diversity of

ownership, aside from the measures that the Third Circuit remanded in Prometheus II, including a 
proposal that the Commission adopt an Overcoming Disadvantage Preference (ODP) standard.
A. Commission Diversity Initiatives and Data Collection Efforts
1. Continuing Diversity Initiatives
237. Diversity Rules and Policies.  The Commission strongly believes that a diverse and 
robust marketplace of ideas is essential to our democracy.  As the Supreme Court has recognized, 
�[s]afeguarding the public�s right to receive a diversity of views and information over the airwaves is . . . 
an integral component of the FCC�s mission.�723 The Commission has established numerous policies and 
rules intended to further the proliferation of diverse and antagonistic sources.724  Toward this end, the 
Commission has a long history of promulgating rules and regulations intended to promote diversity of 
ownership among broadcast licensees, and thereby foster a diversity of voices, by facilitating the 
acquisition and operation of broadcast stations by small businesses, new entrants, and minority- and 
female-owned businesses.725 As explained above, the Commission�s broadcast ownership rules also help 
further this purpose.  For instance, the Commission�s Local Television Ownership Rule promotes 
opportunities for diversity in broadcast ownership by helping to ensure the presence of independently 
owned broadcast television stations in the local market, thereby increasing the likelihood of a variety of 
viewpoints and preserving ownership opportunities for new entrants.726  
238. The Commission and Congress previously adopted race- and gender-conscious measures 
intended specifically to assist minorities and women in their efforts to acquire broadcast properties, such 
as tax certificates and distress sale policies.727 Following the Adarand decision, however, the 
Commission discontinued those policies and programs.  Congress repealed the tax certificate policy in 
1995 as part of its budget approval process.728 Subsequently, the Commission continued its efforts to 
promote viewpoint diversity through a variety of race- and gender-neutral initiatives intended to promote 
diversity of broadcast ownership, and we currently have a number of such rules and initiatives in place.  
As discussed below, we are reinstating the revenue-based eligible entity standard and applying it to the 
regulatory policies set forth in the Diversity Order and remanded in Prometheus II.  We address the 
concerns raised by the court in Prometheus II and find that reinstating the revenue-based eligible entity 
standard and the related regulatory policies will serve our broader goal of diversity of ownership, and thus 
viewpoint diversity, by facilitating small business and new entrant participation in the broadcast industry.  
In addition to these measures, the Commission also took a number of other actions in the Diversity Order 
to promote viewpoint diversity through diversity of ownership.729 Because the Third Circuit expressly 
  
723 Metro Broad., Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 567 (1990), overruled in part on other grounds in Adarand, 515 U.S. at 
227.  
724 See Information Needs of Communities at 313. Furthermore, as noted by the Third Circuit in Prometheus III, 
824 F.3d at 40-41, the Commission has a congressional mandate to disseminate spectrum licenses �among a wide 
variety of applicants, including . . . businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.�  47 U.S.C. � 
309(j)(3)(B).  This statutory directive, however, does not mandate race- or gender-conscious initiatives.  
Furthermore, as discussed below and in the FNPRM, we would need to show that such action satisfies constitutional 
standards.  See infra Section IV.C; FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4497-4509, paras. 284-302.
725 See, e.g., Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcasting Facilities, Public Notice, 68 FCC 2d 979, 
980-81 (1978).  
726 See supra para. 75.
727 See Commission Policy Regarding the Advancement of Minority Ownership in Broadcasting, 92 FCC 2d 849, 
855 (1982); Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcasting Facilities, 68 FCC 2d 979, 983 (1978).
728 See Deduction for Health Insurance Costs of Self-Employed Individuals, Pub. L. No. 104-7, � 2, 109 Stat 93, 93-
94 (1995).     
729 Beyond fostering viewpoint diversity, the Commission has taken steps to facilitate the entry of new participants 
into the broadcasting industry to promote innovation in the field also.  Diversity Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5924, para. 2.

upheld those other actions, they remain in place.730 Those actions include, among others, a ban on 
discrimination in broadcast transactions,731 a �zero tolerance� policy for ownership fraud,732 and a 
requirement that non-discrimination provisions be included in advertising sales contracts.733 Similarly, 
the Prometheus II opinion did not question the Commission�s decision to reinstate the failed station 
solicitation rule (FSSR), which is intended to provide out-of-market buyers, including minorities and 
women, with notice of a sale and an opportunity to bid on stations before the seller seeks a waiver of 
certain ownership rules.734 Accordingly, this measure has remained in place and is retained as part of our 
action today on the local television ownership rule.735 In addition, we note that anecdotal evidence 
suggests that JSAs may have had the effect of enabling large station owners to foreclose entry into 
markets and that the Commission�s decision to attribute JSAs has actually led to greater ownership 
diversity.736
239. OCBO Initiatives.  Additionally, the Commission�s Office of Communications Business 
Opportunities (OCBO) promotes diversity by serving as the principal advisor to the Chairman and the 
(Continued from previous page)    
As discussed below, we believe that in addition to enhancing viewpoint diversity, easing certain regulations for 
small business applicants and licensees by reinstating the revenue-based eligible entity standard and applying it to 
the measures set forth in the Diversity Order will encourage innovation in the broadcasting industry.  See infra 
Section IV.B.

FCC Rcd 3809 (MB 2011).  The court also expressly upheld several other measures adopted by the Commission in 
the Diversity Order, including the commissioning of longitudinal research on minority and women ownership 
trends, enabling the Commission�s Office of Communications Business Opportunities to coordinate with the Small 
Business Administration to encourage local and regional banks to make loans through SBA�s guaranteed loan 
programs, the holding of  �Access to Capital� conferences, and the creation of a guidebook on diversity.  
Prometheus II, 652 F.3d at 471 n.41; see also Diversity Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5939-45, paras. 40-64.  
734 The FSSR provides that, before selling a station to an in-market buyer, an applicant for a failed or failing station 
waiver of the local television ownership rule or the radio/television cross-ownership rule must demonstrate that the 
in-market buyer is the only entity ready, willing, and able to operate the station and that sale to a buyer outside the 
market would result in an artificially depressed price.  47 CFR � 73.3555, Note 7; see also 2006 Quadrennial 
Review Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 2069, para. 109; 1999 Ownership Order, 14 FCC Rcd at 12936-37, para. 74.  In the 
2002 Biennial Review Order, the Commission eliminated the FSSR, finding that the buyer most likely to deliver 
public interest benefits by using the failed, failing, or unbuilt station will be the owner of another station in the same 
market.  18 FCC Rcd at 13708, para. 225.  The Prometheus I court remanded the issue on the basis that the 
Commission did not consider the potential impact on minority owners when it eliminated the rule.  373 F.3d at 420-

Commissioners on issues, rulemakings, and policies affecting small, women-owned, and minority-owned 
communications businesses.  OCBO also hosts workshops and conferences designed to help promote 
small business and minority participation in the communications marketplace.  For example, based on a 
recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Diversity for Communications in the Digital Age, 
OCBO has hosted several capitalization strategies workshops in order to facilitate lending to and 
investment in minority- and women-owned entities.737 OCBO has also hosted an Access to Capital 
Conference and Workshop featuring representatives from the angel investment community who discussed 
their investment strategies in the telecommunications, technology, and media-related industries.738 In 
addition, OCBO has hosted multiple Supplier Diversity Conferences and Workshops, which have focused 
on private sector business opportunities for small, minority- and women-owned businesses.739 At these 
events, industry panelists discussed their organizations� contracting procedures and provided insight on 
how to navigate the procurement process.  
240. OCBO�s efforts to promote small business participation and ownership diversity�in 
broadcast, telecommunications, and new media�have continued since the release of the FNPRM.  In 
January and October 2015, OCBO hosted emerging technology events focused on small businesses, and 
particularly minority and women-owned tech start-ups.740 These events included discussions on entity 
formation/incubation and early stage investment strategies; showcases of app designers, 
software/hardware manufacturers, and Internet-based business owners; and opportunities to pitch ideas 
and products to industry experts.741
  
737 The workshops featured panel discussions with finance experts that examined capitalization strategies for a range 
of media sectors, including broadcast television.  See, e.g., Capitalization Strategies Workshop for Small, Minority-

741 While the Commission remains committed to promoting ownership diversity in broadcast services, new 
technologies also present growing opportunities for small, minority- and women-owned businesses in the media and 
telecommunications industries.  Indeed, in recent years the MMTC conferences on access to capital, which 
previously focused on the broadcast industry, have been expanded to include telecommunications and new 
technologies.  See, e.g., MMTC, MMTC�s 13th Annual Access to Capital and Telecom Policy Conference,

241. Most recently, building off its Supplier Diversity Conference and Workshop, OCBO 
convened a Government Advertising Roundtable that addressed how women- and minority-owned 
businesses in broadcasting can participate in federal government procurements for advertising services, 
among other topics.742 The March 2016 workshop featured broadcast industry and government 
procurement experts who discussed the procurement process for government advertising and how small 
businesses and minority- and women-owned businesses can position themselves to serve the advertising 
needs of the federal government.743 This event, along with OCBO�s many other initiatives, demonstrate 
both the Commission�s continued dedication to promoting small business participation and ownership 
diversity, and the many ways in which the Commission can leverage its resources and reach to connect 
existing owners, new entrants, minority- and women-owned businesses, and entrepreneurs with the 
government and private industry representatives that can potentially help to facilitate station ownership 
and business development.     
242. Foreign Ownership. The Commission has taken steps to help facilitate investment in the 
broadcast industry, which a number of commenters suggest would help to facilitate ownership 
diversity.744 As discussed in the FNPRM, the Commission issued a Declaratory Ruling in November 
2013 clarifying that Section 310(b)(4) of the Communications Act provides the Commission the authority 
to review on a case-by-case basis applications for approval of foreign investment in the controlling U.S. 
parent of a broadcast licensee above the 25 percent statutory benchmark.745 The Commission stated that 
such an application may be granted unless it finds that a denial will serve the public interest.746 In issuing 
the Declaratory Ruling, the Commission noted that limited access to capital is a concern in the broadcast 
industry, particularly for small entities, including entities owned by minorities and women, and further 
noted that a clear articulation of its �approach to Section 310(b)(4) in the broadcast context has the 
potential to spur new and increased opportunities for capitalization for broadcasters, and particularly for 
(Continued from previous page)    
raise capital for new technology, content, and infrastructure businesses, with a special focus on opportunities for 
new entrants and incubated businesses� and �The latest developments in the future of broadband for communities of 
color, including a discussion of content, distribution platforms, and deployment�).

Government Advertising, Public Notice (OCBO Mar. 4, 2016), https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-

743 The panel included government representatives from the Department of Defense�the largest government 
advertiser�Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Transportation, and FCC.  The broadcast industry was 
represented by Sherman Kizart of Kizart Media Partners; Melody Spann-Cooper of Midway Broadcasting 
Corporation; Steve Roberts of the Roberts Companies; and James Winston, President of NABOB.  
744 See, e.g., DCS Supplemental NPRM Comments at 7 (�[R]elaxation [of the Commission�s foreign ownership 
restrictions for broadcast licensees] will . . . provide new funding opportunities for minority broadcast 
entrepreneurs . . . .�); Letter from David Honig, President, MMTC, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, at 1 (filed 
June 7, 2013) (�[R]elaxing the foreign ownership broadcasting restrictions would enhance access to capital for 
minority broadcasters.�); NAB 2012 323 Report Reply at 3-4 (stating that the Commission can provide new 
opportunities to promote greater diversity in broadcast ownership by clarifying that it will conduct a case-by-case 
analysis of proposed foreign ownership in excess of 25 percent of the parent company of a broadcast licensee).
745 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4513, para. 310 (citing Commission Policies and Procedures Under Section 310(b)(4) of 
the Communications Act, Foreign Investment in Broadcast Licensees, Declaratory Ruling, 28 FCC Rcd 16244 
(2013) (Foreign Ownership Declaratory Ruling)).  The Communications Act establishes a 25 percent benchmark for 
foreign investment (by individuals, corporations, and governments) in U.S.-organized entities that control a U.S. 
broadcast, common carrier, or aeronautical radio licensee; any foreign ownership exceeding 25 percent must be 
approved by the Commission.  See 47 U.S.C. � 310(b)(4).

minority, female, small business entities, and new entrants.�747 The Commission also observed that 
greater capitalization may in turn yield greater innovation, particularly in programming directed at niche 
or minority audiences.748
243. Most recently, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to 
extend to broadcast licensees the same streamlined procedures and rules used to review foreign ownership 
in common carrier licensees, with certain tailored modifications.749 These changes would, among other 
things, allow a broadcast licensee to request Commission approval for its U.S. controlling parent to have 
up to and including 100 percent foreign ownership and for any noncontrolling named foreign investor to 
increase its interest in the U.S. parent up to and including a noncontrolling interest of 49.99 percent.750  
The item also sought comment on whether and how to revise the methodology a licensee should use to 
assess its compliance with the 25 percent foreign ownership benchmark in Section 310(b)(4) in order to 
reduce regulatory burdens on applicants and licensees.751 These proposed changes, if adopted, could 
facilitate investment from new sources of capital at a time of growing need for investment in the 
broadcast sector.  Further, MMTC and others believe that these proposed changes could potentially 
benefit minority-owned broadcasters and facilitate diverse programming.752  
244. Tax Certificate Legislation. Consistent with comments in the record, the Commission�s 
most recent Section 257 Report to Congress includes a recommendation that Congress pass tax deferral 
legislation.753 Specifically, the report proposes a new tax incentive program to spur ownership diversity 
among small businesses, including those owned by women and minorities.754 The report notes that such a 
program could permit deferral of the taxes on any capital gain involved in the sale of communications 
businesses to small firms, as long as that gain is reinvested in one or more qualifying communications 
businesses, and states that such a program could permit tax credits for sellers of communications 
properties who offer financing to small firms.755
  
747 Id. at 16249, para. 10.  As it has done in its review of foreign ownership of common carrier applicants and 
licensees, the Commission indicated that it will continue to afford appropriate deference to the expertise of the 
Executive Branch agencies on issues related to national security, law enforcement, foreign policy, and trade policy.

245. AM Revitalization.  As discussed in the FNPRM, several of the Diversity and 
Competition Supporter�s (DCS) proposals involve modifications to the AM broadcast service, and the AM 
Revitalization NPRM solicited comment on a number of the technical issues that DCS raised in this 
proceeding.756 Given the nature of these proposals, it is important to consider them in the broader context 
of the Commission�s efforts to revitalize the AM service.  Since the release of the FNPRM, the
Commission has adopted the six proposals set forth in the AM Revitalization NPRM, including a modified 
daytime community coverage requirement for existing licensed AM facilities, a modified nighttime 
community coverage requirement for new and existing AM stations, and modified AM antenna efficiency 
standards.757 We believe that our actions in the AM Revitalization Order will assist AM broadcasters to 
better serve the public, thereby advancing the Commission�s fundamental goals of diversity, competition, 
and localism in broadcast media.  These actions address some of the technical issues that DCS has raised 
in this proceeding with regard to the AM broadcast service.758 In addition, the AM Revitalization FNPRM 
and AM Revitalization NOI seek comment on other technical issues that DCS has raised in this 
proceeding, including whether to require licensees with dual standard/Expanded Band authorizations to 
surrender one of the two authorizations by a certain time, whether to allow further utilization of the AM 
Expanded Band, and whether to modify the main studio rule.759 We note that some commenters regard 
the AM radio service as a critical point of entry for women and minorities seeking to become 
broadcasters.760  
246. Hispanic Television Study.  In addition, the Commission conducted a study of Hispanic 
television viewing.761 The study is the Commission�s first systematic examination of the Hispanic 
television marketplace, which comprises a growing segment of the nation�s population.  The study 
incorporates comprehensive data from our Form 323 biennial ownership reports.  Specifically, the study 
considers:  (1) the impact of Hispanic-owned television stations on Hispanic-oriented programming and 
Hispanic viewership in selected local television markets; and (2) the extent of Hispanic-oriented 
programming on U.S. broadcast television.  The study was released on May 12, 2016, with comments due 
on May 26, 2016, and replies on June 3, 2016; however, the Commission subsequently extended the 
deadlines to June 2, 2016, and June 9, 2016, respectively.762
247. The results of the study�s regression analysis�which identifies correlations (but not 
necessarily causal relationships) between Hispanic-owned stations and programming and viewing 
choices�indicate that, among other things, Hispanic viewers favor the major Spanish-language networks, 
  
756 Those technical issues included (1) a modified daytime community coverage standard for existing AM stations; 
(2) modified nighttime community coverage standards for existing AM stations; and (3) modified AM antenna 
efficiency standards.  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4516-17, para. 316 (citing AM Radio Revitalization NPRM, 28 FCC

especially Univision (which is not Hispanic-owned); watch local, Spanish-language news at higher levels 
than English-language news; and watch more telenovelas than other program types. 
248. With regard to programming, the study finds that Hispanic-owned stations are less likely 
to show telenovelas relative to other programming types; paid programming is strongly associated with 
Hispanic ownership; and Spanish-language programming and local programming are more likely to be 
shown on Hispanic-owned stations than other types of programming.  For example, Spanish-language 
programs are nearly 30 times more likely to appear on Hispanic-owned stations than English-language 
programs, while local programs are nearly six times more likely than non-local.  Additionally, paid 
programs are three times more likely to be shown on Hispanic-owned stations than other types of 
programs, while telenovelas are about 30 percent less likely to be found on Hispanic-owned stations and 
about 80 percent less likely to be on the Hispanic-owned independent stations.
249. The study finds some indication that Hispanic ownership is associated with higher ratings 
among Hispanics, and in particular among Hispanics viewing Spanish-language local programming.  This 
may suggest that the programming choices of Hispanic-owned stations may lead to increased viewership 
among Hispanics compared to their viewing of stations that are not Hispanic-owned.  The study notes, 
however, that these results are only statistically significant when examining the viewing of individual 
programs.  When averaging viewing across programs to examine the ratings of a television station, the 
study does not find a statistically significant effect of Hispanic-ownership, perhaps due to small sample 
size.  The study also finds that markets with large Hispanic populations have more Hispanic programming 
available, as would be expected.  In addition, while certain kinds of programming on Hispanic-owned 
stations seems to correspond with higher ratings, the results largely indicate that the ratings of Hispanic-
owned stations are well below the ratings of the non-Hispanic-owned stations affiliated with the large 
Spanish-language networks such as Univision and Telemundo.
250. Numerous commenters supported the Hispanic Television Study and the Commission�s 
efforts to analyze the relationships between Hispanic-owned television stations, programming, and 
viewership.763 They recognize the difficulty and expense of undertaking such studies, and commend the 
Commission for conducting a study of important issues relevant to minority ownership and viewpoint 
diversity.764 NHMC applauds the Commission�s completion of the Hispanic Television Study and 
encourages an aggressive research agenda.765  
251. Some commenters, however, expressed concern regarding the study design, including the 
focus on entertainment programming and the popularity of certain programming, such as telenovelas.766  
Because of the emphasis on program popularity and ratings, UCC et al. contend that the study does �little 
to assist� the Commission in its ongoing review of broadcast ownership rules pursuant to Section 
202(h).767 They argue that programming popularity is unrelated to the agency�s longstanding goal of 
promoting viewpoint diversity.768 Additionally, NHMC asserts that by primarily equating Spanish-
language content with Hispanic-oriented content the study only focuses on a narrow subset of diverse

767 UCC et al. Hispanic TV Study Comments at 2-3.  To the contrary, the Hispanic Television Study did not analyze 
only ratings.  It examined the availability of Hispanic-oriented programming, finding some limited evidence that 
certain types of programming are associated with Hispanic ownership.  These findings go to the availability of 
programming to the entire audience and not solely to the nature of viewership.

content and fails to fully value English-language content that Hispanic viewers and the general public 
frequently access, including English-language content produced by Hispanic-owned stations.769 NHMC 
further asserts that the Commission cannot rely on this study alone to justify the impact of a particular 
�eligible entity� definition or as evidence that it should move forward with relaxing any of its media 
ownership rules because the Hispanic Television Study does not speak to either issue.770  
252. As noted above, many commenters support the Commission�s undertaking of the 
Hispanic Television Study.  We recognize, however, that no one study, including the Hispanic Television 
Study, will be responsive to the many and varied concerns raised by commenters.  The objective of the 
study was to attempt to examine the nexus, if any, between Hispanic ownership of broadcast television 
stations and Hispanic-oriented program content.771 In view of the fact that many of the Spanish-language 
television stations are not Hispanic-owned, the examination was challenging, and the study found only 
limited evidence to support a nexus between Hispanic ownership and Hispanic-oriented program 
content.772 However, the study has improved the Commission�s and the public�s understanding of the 
potential relationship between ownership and content, particularly as it relates to Hispanic ownership of 
broadcast television stations. 
253. We also reject criticisms that the study was too narrowly focused, i.e., focusing primarily 
on Spanish-language content and Hispanic audience members.773 We clarify that there was not an 
assumption that Hispanic-oriented programming benefits only Hispanic viewers.  Rather, the study noted 
that Hispanic viewers constitute virtually all of the viewers of Spanish-language programming.  The study 
noted that for the non-Hispanic audience, 99 percent of viewing is English-language programming and 1 
percent is of Spanish-language programming.774 Thus, the impact of Spanish-language programming on 
the non-Hispanic market is apparently quite small.  Further, as noted at Table 8 of the study, the Hispanic-
owned stations provide predominantly Spanish-language programming.775
254. We similarly dispute the suggestion by Public Knowledge/Common Cause that the study 
is outdated because certain of the stations in the study may no longer be Hispanic-owned.776 We reiterate 
  
769 NHMC Hispanic TV Study Comments at 2.  NHMC observes that the study authors admit that using language as 
a criterion to determine whether programming is �Hispanic-oriented� is limited �because a large fraction of the U.S. 
Hispanic community is bilingual and one can easily imagine English-language content aimed at this community.�

776 Public Knowledge/Common Cause Hispanic TV Study Comments at 1-2; see also Media Vista Hispanic TV 
Study Comments at 5-6 (asserting that the study should have used more recent data).  In response to Media Vista, 
we note that the Hispanic Television Study began in October 2013 and utilized the most recent broadcast television 
ownership information available at that time.  Those data, providing a snapshot of ownership information as of 
October 1, 2011, had been released by the Commission on November 14, 2012.  Building on the most recent 
ownership data then available, the Commission then purchased viewing data and programming data from The 
Nielsen Company and Tribune Media Service (now Gracenote), respectively, that matched the 2011 time period 
dictated by the ownership information.  In order for the dataset to be consistent and ensure the quality and integrity 
of the results, it was critical that the time period covered by the various data sources match.  Although newer data on 
ownership, viewing, and programming became available over the course of the study, any attempt to substitute 
additional data would have resulted in significant additional expense and delays due to the extremely intricate and 
complicated job of matching disparate data sets not designed to match one another.
Federal Communications Commission FCC 16-107

that the study attempted to discern the relationship between Hispanic ownership and Hispanic-oriented 
programming.  As such, the data and time period are appropriate for studying those possible relationships 
even if some of the stations are no longer Hispanic-owned.  While having more recent data has its 
advantages, it is not clear that more recent data would provide a significantly larger database of Hispanic-
owned stations, nor does it change the outcome of our analysis in the Hispanic Television Study, which 
was based on observations during the relevant time periods.   
255. Finally, Hispanic-owned television broadcaster Media Vista claims that the Hispanic 
Television Study �does not present a complete picture� of Hispanic broadcast ownership because it fails to 
take into account the LPTV stations owned by Media Vista and other Hispanic-owned LPTV stations.777  
Media Vista adds that the Commission should not ignore data that it expressly deemed to be necessary 
and valuable to provide a complete ownership picture.778  In constructing the dataset for the markets in 
which Nielsen measures Hispanic household viewing, Commission staff utilized the 2011 Form 323 
ownership data. This was done in order to align station ownership information with available Nielsen 
ratings data from the November 2011 and May 2012 sweeps periods.  There was no decision to exclude 
any particular class or type of television stations; rather, Nielsen ratings data is not available for all 
stations.  For the period examined in the Hispanic Television Study, the stations identified by Media Vista 
did not have reportable Nielsen data and were thus excluded from the data set.  And while the lack of 
Nielsen data precluded inclusion of the stations in this particular study, the Form 323 ownership data for 
these (and all) stations helps to inform the Commission�s and the public�s understanding of the ownership 
characteristics of the broadcast industry and may help inform subsequent efforts to study issues of 
ownership and programming.
2. Continuing Improvements to Data Collection
256. As explained in the FNPRM, the Commission actively has sought to improve its 
collection and analysis of broadcast ownership information.779 We noted that the Commission had 
already implemented major changes to its Form 323 biennial ownership reports to improve the reliability 
and utility of the data reported on the form, including data regarding minority and female ownership of 
broadcast stations.780 We acknowledged that previous shortcomings in the Form 323 data had impaired 
the ability of the Commission and interested parties to study and analyze issues related to minority and 
female ownership.  However, we noted that the Commission had responded to Form 323-related 
criticisms and suggestions by substantially revising the form and making certain data from the 2009 
biennial Form 323 report filings, as well as previous data collected by the Commission and third parties, 
available to the authors of the 11 peer-reviewed media ownership studies that are included in the record of 
this proceeding.781 And as discussed in more detail below, the Commission recently adopted additional, 
significant improvements to its broadcast ownership data collection, including revisions to Form 323-E 
for noncommercial educational broadcast stations that will enhance the completeness of the data 
collection, promote data integrity, and ensure that the data are electronically readable and aggregable.782  
257. In response to the FNPRM, several commenters take issue with the Form 323 collection 
process, including the response rate of respondents, completeness of the data collection (e.g., no

requirement that noncommercial educational (NCE) broadcast stations provide race, ethnicity, and gender 
information), and analysis and presentation of the data.783 For example, while acknowledging that the 
response rates have improved since 2009, multiple commenters raise concerns about the response rates 
for particular services, such as AM radio and LPTV stations.784 These commenters urge the Commission 
to take steps to improve the response rates, including the use of enforcement actions against stations that 
fail to file.785 UCC et al. urge the Commission to complete its initiatives to improve the completeness and 
accuracy of its Form 323 data collection.786 WGAW asks the Commission to make various changes to the 
Consolidated Database System (CDBS) that, according to WGAW, would promote transparency.787

assess the impact of retaining or amending the media ownership limits on minority- and women-owned businesses, 
such as information about television SSAs, local news service agreements, and other joint ventures that station 
owners may be using to circumvent the local television rule.  Id. at 24-25.  As discussed below, we are adopting a 
definition of SSAs and requiring the disclosure of SSAs involving commercial television stations.  See supra Section 
V.
787 WGAW FNPRM Comments at 15 (�[T]he Commission should update [CDBS] to include all information 
collected in the station file and in the license application and make such data available in exportable file formats.�); 
id. (�Information on SSAs and JSAs should be included in the CDBS and summarized in the Commission�s annual 
video competition report.�).  These proposed changes, however, do not appear to improve the Commission�s data 
collection efforts for diversity purposes, or otherwise promote ownership diversity, and are therefore outside the 
scope of this proceeding.  In addition, we believe that the WGAW proposal would impose significant costs on the 
Commission that appear to exceed any possible benefits at this time.  Prior to 2016, the Commission required only 
broadcast TV stations to upload public file documents to a central, FCC-hosted online database.  The Commission 
recently expanded this obligation to broadcast radio stations and other entities, and at this time only certain radio 
stations are required to upload public file materials to the Commission�s online public file database.  Other radio 
stations are not required to upload their public file materials to the Commission�s online database until March 2018.  
See Expansion of Online Public File Obligations to Cable and Satellite TV Operators and Broadcast and Satellite 
Radio Licensees, Report and Order, 31 FCC Rcd 526 (2016).  The FCC-hosted online public file is a separate 
database from CDBS, where the Commission currently receives and stores data from broadcast ownership filings.

258. Commenters also restate earlier concerns that the reports that Commission staff issue 
summarizing 323 data present the Commission�s ownership data in a format that commenters assert is 
difficult for researchers to use and with no analysis.788 In addition, some commenters criticize the 323 
Reports for failing to provide certain information about minority owners, such as call signs, broadcast 
location, and market information.789 According to UCC et al., this information is essential for 
commenters to analyze how amending or retaining the Commission�s media ownership limits would 
affect minority and female ownership.790 As discussed below, we have taken significant steps to address 
these concerns.  
259. Collection of Biennial Ownership Data. As discussed above, the Commission has 
improved its collection and analysis of broadcast ownership information.  Indeed, our recent efforts have 
largely addressed the concerns expressed by certain commenters.  The Commission has been engaged in a 
sustained effort to improve the quality, utility, and reliability of broadcast ownership data it collects on 
FCC Forms 323 and 323-E.  In 2009, the Commission substantially revised Form 323 to facilitate 
longitudinal comparative studies of broadcast station ownership.791 The changes also addressed Form 
323-related criticisms and suggestions from the United States Government Accountability Office 
(GAO)792 and from researchers who had attempted to use the data submitted on previous versions of Form 
(Continued from previous page)    
However, as discussed below, complete raw data from the Commission�s broadcast ownership filings, as well as 
CDBS public database files, are available for download on the Commission�s website, and it is updated on a daily 
basis to account for new and amended filings.  Researchers and other parties currently can download the data files 
from the Commission�s website at any time and study, search, and manipulate the data in a wide variety of ways.  
See infra paras. 267-268.  This suggests that developing an extensive catalog of complex query options within the 
public search functionality of our electronic filing system would impose unnecessary costs on the Commission.  
Also, we note that the Commission decided in the Form 323/CORES Report and Order to add a new positional 
interest category to Form 323 for parties that are attributable by virtue of a JSA or LMA.  31 FCC Rcd at 439, para.

323 to analyze broadcast ownership issues in the 2006 Quadrennial Review proceeding.793
260. To improve the quality of its broadcast ownership data, the Commission adopted several 
significant changes to Form 323 in the 323 Order.  The Commission established a new, machine-readable 
Form 323 that enabled for the first time electronic analysis of the reports filed by television and radio 
broadcasters.  The Commission also set a uniform filing deadline of November 1 for biennial ownership 
reports on Form 323 and required filers to report their ownership interests as they exist on October 1 of 
the filing year.794 These uniform dates make it possible to discern statistically valid trends in minority and 
female broadcast ownership over time, which was not possible using the previous rolling filing deadlines, 
and to ensure the timely collection of the data.795 The Commission also expanded the requirement to file 
Form 323 biennially to include sole proprietors and partnerships of natural persons, as well as low power 
television (LPTV) and Class A television licensees.796  
261. Most recently, the Commission in 2016 adopted a number of additional enhancements to 
its broadcast ownership data collection in order to further improve the comprehensiveness and reliability 
of the data.  These recent enhancements will enable more effective analysis of ownership trends in 
support of the Commission�s policy initiatives.  In particular, the Commission implemented a Restricted 
Use FCC Registration Number (Restricted Use FRN)�a new identifier within the Commission�s 
Registration System (CORES)�that will allow for unique identification of individuals listed on broadcast 
ownership reports, without necessitating the disclosure to the Commission of individuals� full Social 
Security Numbers.797 The Commission also eliminated the availability of the interim Special Use FRN 
for individuals reported on broadcast ownership reports, except in certain limited circumstances.  Because 
the Special Use FRN offers no way for the Commission to identify individuals reliably, restricting its use 
will improve the integrity and utility of the Commission�s broadcast ownership data.798  
262. In addition, the Commission prescribed revisions to Form 323-E for NCE broadcast 
stations that will conform the reporting requirements for NCE stations more closely to those for 
commercial stations filing Form 323.  Specifically, the Commission revised Form 323-E to collect race, 
gender, and ethnicity information for attributable interest holders; to require that CORES FRNs or 
Restricted Use FRNs be used; and to conform the biennial filing deadline for NCE station ownership 
reports to the biennial filing deadline for commercial station ownership reports.799 These revisions to 
Form 323-E will enhance the completeness of the Commission�s broadcast ownership data collection, 
promote data integrity, and ensure that the data are electronically readable and aggregable.  These

revisions address criticisms that the Commission�s race, ethnicity, and gender data were incomplete 
because the Commission had not previously collected such data relating to NCE stations.800  
263. The Commission also adopted a number of other changes to Forms 323 and 323-E that 
will streamline the filing process and improve data quality.801 These changes are intended to provide 
filers with additional time for completing and submitting biennial ownership reports, while reducing the 
amount of time and resources required to address the mechanical aspects of the ownership report 
preparation and filing process, thereby allowing parties to spend more time focused on the accuracy and 
completeness of the ownership information they submit to the Commission.
264. Together, the further enhancements that we adopted in the Form 323/CORES Report and 
Order will enable the Commission to obtain data providing a more useful, accurate, and thorough picture 
of minority and female broadcast station ownership, while reducing filing burdens.  These improvements 
also address the Third Circuit�s directive that the Commission obtain more and better data concerning 
broadcast ownership to support its rulemaking decisions.  Ultimately, we believe that these actions will 
assist efforts to study and analyze issues related to minority and female ownership, by both the 
Commission and third parties.  And as explained in the following discussion, the Commission has also 
taken a number of other steps to improve its collection of ownership data.
265. Improving Response Rates and Data Quality.  In addition to substantially revising Forms 
323 and 323-E, the Commission has made ongoing outreach efforts to assist filers in an effort to improve 
response rates and to reduce common filing errors.  Prior to the 2011, 2013, and 2015 biennial filing 
periods for Form 323, the Media Bureau released public notices to remind licensees of commercial AM, 
FM, TV, LPTV, and Class A television stations, as well as all entities with attributable interests in such 
stations, of their obligation to file a biennial ownership report.802 To assist both novice and experienced 
filers, the Bureau has hosted information sessions regarding the filing of biennial ownership reports on 
Form 323.  During the most recent session, which was held prior to the start of the 2015 biennial filing 
window, Bureau staff presented an overview of the form, conducted a filing demonstration, discussed 
common filing mistakes, and responded to questions from the public.803 The Commission has made a 
video recording of this information session available on its website to assist filers.804
266. In addition to these efforts, the Media Bureau has established several online resources for 
filers.  Those resources include a dedicated Form 323 webpage containing links to notices and other 
documents regarding Form 323,805 a Frequently Asked Questions webpage providing useful information 
about the form and its electronic filing capabilities, and a webpage identifying some of the most common 
filing errors and ways to avoid them, which Bureau staff compiled based on experience during previous 
biennial filing periods.  At Form323@fcc.gov, Bureau staff also respond to inquiries received from filers 
(e.g., licensees and attributable entities) and the public regarding the filing of commercial biennial

803 Media Bureau Announces Biennial Form 323 Information Session, Public Notice, 30 FCC Rcd 8455 (Aug. 20, 
2015).  The filing window for the 2015 Form 323 biennial ownership report filings closed on December 2, 2015.
Commission staff is currently compiling a report based on those filings, and we expect that the forthcoming report 
will help inform future Commission proceedings.

ownership reports.  We believe these ongoing outreach efforts will continue to further the Commission�s 
objective of improving its broadcast ownership data collection, and we anticipate similar outreach efforts 
with respect to the modified Forms 323 and 323-E, as filers transition to the new forms and filing 
procedures.  
267. Analysis of Ownership Data.  In order to assist parties in their ability to access and 
analyze the ownership data, the Commission has ensured that the data submitted on Form 323 are 
incorporated into a relational database, the most common database format, which is standard for large, 
complex, interrelated datasets.  Complete raw data from the Commission�s broadcast ownership filings, 
both current and historical, are available for download from the Commission�s website, and the data are 
updated on a daily basis to account for new and amended filings.806 Researchers and other parties may 
download the data files from the Commission�s website at any time and study, search, and manipulate the 
data in a wide variety of ways.  The Commission has made explanatory documents publicly available and 
easy to find.  Also, in response to requests from outside parties, the Commission now provides 
spreadsheets that contain additional ownership data, such as call signs, broadcast location, and market 
information.  These spreadsheets are released with the 323 Reports to help present a broader picture of the 
biennial Form 323 data.  
268. In addition, the Media Bureau hosted an all-day public workshop in September 2015 to 
assist individuals and organizations that wish to use and study the large amount of broadcast ownership 
data that is available to the public on the Commission�s website.807 The workshop addressed a number of 
topics concerning access to, and use of, the Commission�s commercial broadcast ownership data, 
including relevant data that the Commission collects, how members of the public can access those data, 
and mechanisms for querying, studying, and visualizing the data, including in combination with data 
available from non-FCC sources.  The workshop, a video of which is available online, provides 
researchers with the tools and understanding to electronically search, aggregate, and cross reference the 
data in order to prepare their own analysis.808
269. We reiterate that the Commission does not consider the 323 Reports to be studies that 
would help support the adoption of race- or gender-based preferences or policies�indeed, they are not 
studies at all.  These Reports, and the accompanying spreadsheets, contain valuable data about minority 
and female ownership of broadcast stations.  The Reports aggregate the data and are not in and of 
themselves a study of ownership information.  The Commission has used the data from the 2012 and 
2014 323 Reports to inform its analyses in this proceeding.809 In addition, ownership data from Form 323 
filings have been incorporated into multiple studies.  As noted above, seven of the 11 peer-reviewed 
media ownership studies in the record as of the date of the FNPRM incorporated the 2009 Form 323 data, 
as well as previous data collected by the Commission and third parties.810 These studies examine issues 
such as media quality, innovation, viewpoint diversity, local information programming, the provision of 
programming to minority audiences, and local television news.811 These studies have been discussed

extensively in the record, both in the context of individual media ownership rules and in the 
Commission�s response to the remand issues from Prometheus II.  We also note that the Hispanic 
Television Study included 2011 Form 323 data.  The study is the Commission�s first systematic 
examination of the Hispanic television marketplace and is one of the first to incorporate comprehensive 
data from the recently improved 323 ownership form.      
270. The Commission�s improved ownership data are already contributing to meaningful 
analysis and studies regarding media ownership and diversity policies.  We are hopeful that interested 
parties will use the data to conduct further studies and analyses�particularly with respect to trends 
concerning broadcast station ownership by minorities and women�endeavors that should be aided by the 
Commission�s research workshop, discussed above.
B. Remand Review of the Revenue-Based Eligible Entity Standard
1. Background
271. In the NPRM the Commission sought comment on a number of actions it could take with 
respect to the remanded eligible entity definition, including the possibility of reinstating the revenue-
based definition to support policy objectives other than increased minority and female ownership of 
broadcast stations.812 In particular, the Commission asked whether re-adoption of the revenue-based 
standard would serve the Commission�s traditional goals of fostering viewpoint diversity, localism, and 
competition by enhancing opportunities in broadcasting for small businesses and new entrants.813  
Recognizing the Third Circuit�s apparent skepticism that the Commission would be able to demonstrate 
on remand that the revenue-based eligible entity standard promotes increased ownership of broadcast 
stations by minorities and women, the Commission also asked commenters to supply any available 
evidence that would show a stronger connection between the revenue-based eligible entity definition and 
our goal of increasing minority and female ownership of broadcast stations.814
272. The Commission adopted the revenue-based eligible entity definition in the 2002 
Biennial Review Order as an exception to the prohibition on the transfer of grandfathered station 
combinations that violated the local radio ownership limits.815 The Commission adopted this flexible 
transfer policy to promote diversity of ownership in broadcasting by facilitating new entry by and growth 
of small businesses in the broadcast industry.816 Thereafter, in the Diversity Order, the Commission 
concluded that additional uses of the eligible entity definition would advance its objectives of promoting 
ownership diversity by facilitating greater small business participation in the broadcast industry.817 The 
Commission stated at that time that the adoption of new measures relying on this definition would �be

licensees to assign or transfer control of a grandfathered combination to an eligible entity, which the Commission 
defined as any entity that would qualify as a small business consistent with revenue-based standards for its industry 
grouping, as established by the SBA.  The exception also allowed eligible entities to sell existing grandfathered 
combinations intact to new owners, subject to limited restrictions.  Id. at 13810-12, paras. 488-90.
816 Id. at 13810-11, para. 488.
817 Diversity Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5926, para. 7.  The Commission adopted the following measures that relied on 
the eligible entity definition:  (1) Revision of Rules Regarding Construction Permit Deadlines; (2) Modification of 
Attribution Rule; (3) Distress Sale Policy; (4) Duopoly Priority for Companies that Finance or Incubate an Eligible 
Entity; (5) Extension of Divestiture Deadline in Certain Mergers; and (6) Assignment or Transfer of Grandfathered 
Radio Station Combinations.  Id. at 5928-45, paras. 10-61.

effective in creating new opportunities for broadcast ownership by a variety of small businesses and new 
entrants, including minorities and women.�818  
273. In Prometheus II, the Third Circuit vacated and remanded each of the measures adopted 
in the Diversity Order that incorporated the eligible entity definition.819 The court held that the 
Commission failed to show that measures based on the eligible entity definition �will enhance 
significantly minority and female ownership,� which it found was a stated goal of the rulemaking 
proceeding culminating in the Diversity Order.820 The court further observed that, in discussing its 
decision to adopt the eligible entity definition, the Commission had referred �only to �small businesses,� 
and occasionally �new entrants,� as expected beneficiaries.�821  Between 2002 and the Third Circuit�s 
remand of the measures relying on the eligible entity definition in 2011, the Commission had used the 
revenue-based standard to support a range of measures intended to encourage ownership diversity.
274. In response to the NPRM, several commenters, including the Alliance for Women in 
Media (AWM) and NAB, supported reinstatement of the revenue-based eligible entity definition and the 
measures to which it previously applied as a means of enhancing ownership opportunities for small 
businesses and new entrants generally, regardless of race or gender.822 In its comments, NAB noted that 
reinstating the pre-existing eligible entity standard and the measures that relied on that standard would 
further the Commission�s statutory goal of eliminating market barriers for entrepreneurs and small 
businesses.823 UCC et al. recommended that, instead of abandoning or repurposing the revenue-based 
definition, the Commission should assess whether the standard has had any measurable impact on 
minority and female ownership of broadcast stations.824 In contrast, other commenters, such as DCS, 
argued that the pre-existing eligible entity definition should not be reinstated because it had no 
measurable impact on minority ownership.825 According to DCS, no meaningful impact on minority 
ownership would be achieved by relying on a definition based solely upon the revenue limits that the 
SBA has established for small businesses.826
275. In the FNPRM, we tentatively concluded that reinstating the revenue-based eligible entity 
standard would serve the public interest by enabling more small businesses to participate in the broadcast 
industry, thereby encouraging innovation and expanding ownership and viewpoint diversity.827 We 
tentatively concluded that such a standard is an appropriate and worthwhile approach for expanding 
ownership diversity regardless of whether the standard was also effective in promoting ownership of

broadcast stations specifically by women and minorities.828 Noting that the Commission has previously 
applied SBA standards to define eligible entities, we proposed to define an eligible entity as any entity�
commercial or noncommercial�that would qualify as a small business consistent with SBA standards for 
its industry grouping, based on revenue.829 We proposed to require an eligible entity to satisfy one of 
several control tests to ensure that ultimate control rests in an entity that satisfies the revenue criteria.830  
Further, we tentatively concluded that, if we chose to reinstate the eligible entity definition, it would be 
appropriate to re-adopt each of the previous measures that relied on this definition prior to remand in 
Prometheus II.  We noted in the FNPRM that our records indicated that a significant number of applicants 
and permittees had previously availed themselves of one or more of those measures.831
276. Although no commenters challenge the FNPRM�s tentative conclusion that reinstating the 
revenue-based eligible entity standard will promote small business participation in broadcasting, some 
commenters assert that the standard has not been shown to increase ownership of broadcast stations by 
minorities and women specifically�something that the FNPRM explicitly acknowledges.  MMTC states 
that the FNPRM fails to include any meaningful proposals to advance minority ownership and does not 
promote the creation of a meaningful eligible entities program pursuant to the Third Circuit�s remand.832  
Rather, MMTC argues, the FNPRM reverts to a flawed eligible entities definition based on SBA size 
standards with little regard for whether this approach will promote minority media ownership 
effectively.833 UCC et al. state that the Commission, by proposing to re-adopt a revenue-based eligible 
entity definition, fails to act on their prior suggestion that the Commission assess whether a small 
business definition had any impact on ownership by minorities and women.834 UCC et al. acknowledge 
that in the FNPRM the Commission cited data to support its tentative conclusion that the revenue-based 
eligible entity standard promotes viewpoint diversity, but those commenters suggest that the Commission 
should have also analyzed whether any entities controlled by women or minorities were among those that 
benefited from the policies relying on the eligible entity standard.835 According to UCC et al., the fact 
that the Commission did not cite evidence demonstrating that the revenue-based eligible entity standard 
will specifically promote minority and female ownership of broadcast stations, combined with the low

will hold the broadcast license; (2) 15 percent or more of the stock/partnership shares and more than 50 percent 
voting power of the corporation or partnership that will hold the broadcast licenses, provided that no other person or 
entity owns or controls more than 25 percent of the outstanding stock or partnership interest; or (3) more than 50

company.  Diversity Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5925-26, para. 6 n.14 (citing 2002 Biennial Review Order, 18 FCC Rcd

number of stations controlled by minorities or women while the revenue-based standard was in effect, 
confirms that the revenue-based standard lacks a sufficient analytical connection to promoting broadcast 
ownership by minorities and women.836  
277. Native Public Media and the National Congress of American Indians (NPM/NCAI) agree 
with those commenters who oppose the tentative conclusion that re-adopting the previous eligible entity 
definition is an appropriate measure to further diversity in response to the court�s remand.837 NPM/NCAI 
argue that, in order to advance ownership diversity, the Commission could expand the definition of 
eligible entity to include Tribes and Tribal applicants until such time as sufficient evidence is developed 
to support a race-conscious eligible entity definition.838 NPM/NCAI advocate this expansion of the 
eligible entity definition as an interim step that the Commission could take now while it conducts further 
studies on which race- and gender-specific actions could be taken.839  
278. Although they object to the reinstatement of the revenue-based eligible entity standard, 
DCS urge the Commission not to abandon the policy of allowing the transfer of grandfathered radio 
combinations under certain conditions or the policy of affording eligible entities that acquire broadcast 
construction permits additional time to construct their facilities under certain circumstances.840 Further, 
DCS and MMTC urge the Commission to broaden the construction deadline extension policy to include 
construction permits for major modifications of authorized broadcast facilities.841  NAB similarly supports 
the policy regarding the transfer of grandfathered radio station combinations, as well as other race-neutral, 
incentive-based approaches that reduce barriers to entry, such as the reinstatement of the higher Equity 
Debt Plus (EDP) attribution threshold for eligible entities.842 However, UCC et al. argue that without an 
alternative eligible entity definition that is reasonably and explicitly related to the specific goal of 
increasing ownership of broadcast stations by women and minorities, re-adopting the higher EDP 
attribution threshold and the policy regarding the transfer of grandfathered radio combinations will not 
promote minority and female ownership.843  
2. Discussion  
279. We conclude that the Commission�s prior revenue-based eligible entity definition should 
be reinstated and applied to the regulatory policies set forth in the Diversity Order.  We find that 
reinstating the eligible entity definition and the measures to which it applied will serve the public interest 
by promoting small business participation in the broadcast industry and potential entry by new 
entrepreneurs.  As discussed below, we find that the record supports these conclusions.  Accordingly, we 
reinstate our previous revenue-based eligible entity definition and the measures adopted in the Diversity

Order that were vacated and remanded by the Third Circuit in Prometheus II.
280. We conclude that the revenue-based eligible entity standard is a reasonable and effective 
means of promoting broadcast station ownership by small businesses and potential new entrants.  We 
continue to believe that small business applicants and licensees often have financial and operational needs 
that are distinct from those of larger broadcasters, and that they require greater flexibility with regard to 
licensing, construction, auctions, and transactions.  By easing certain regulations for small business 
applicants and licensees, we believe we will increase station ownership opportunities for small businesses 
and new entrants, to the benefit of the public interest.  
281. Moreover, we conclude that our traditional policy objectives will be served by enhancing 
opportunities for small business participation in the broadcast industry via the eligible entity standard.  
We continue to believe that enabling more small businesses to participate in the broadcast industry will 
encourage innovation and promote competition and viewpoint diversity.  As the Commission has noted 
previously, greater small business participation in communications markets �will expand the pool of 
potential competitors� and �should bring new competitive strategies and approaches by broadcast station 
owners in ways that benefit consumers in those markets.�844 We continue to believe that this is true.  
Furthermore, increasing opportunities for small businesses to participate in the broadcast industry will 
foster viewpoint diversity by facilitating the dissemination of broadcast licenses to a wider variety of 
applicants than would otherwise be the case.  Competition and viewpoint diversity are two primary policy 
objectives that have traditionally guided the Commission�s analysis of broadcast ownership issues.  
282. The record supports these conclusions.  Commenters, including AWM and NAB, agree 
that re-adopting the revenue-based eligible entity standard is an appropriate means of enhancing 
ownership opportunities for small businesses and new entrants.845 Although UCC et al. criticize our 
proposal to reinstate the revenue-based standard, they also acknowledge the data we cited in the FNPRM
to support our conclusion that the standard promotes viewpoint diversity.846 UCC et al. and other 
commenters that criticize the revenue-based eligible entity standard do so based on their view that the 
standard is not an effective means of increasing ownership specifically by women and minorities.847

24; NPM/NCAI FNPRM Reply at 6; DCS NPRM Comments at 19.  As noted above, NPM/NCAI argue that, 
pending further action on a race- and gender-conscious eligible entity standard, the Commission �can take another 
significant step towards overcoming th[e] underrepresentation [of Native Americans in broadcast station ownership] 
by expanding the definition of eligible entity to include Native Nations.�  See NPM/NCAI FNPRM Reply at 6-8.  As 
discussed above, we are re-instating the revenue-based eligible entity standard to promote broadcast station 
ownership by small businesses and new entrants.  We do not believe it is necessary to expand our revenue-based 
eligible entity definition to include Tribes and Tribal Applicants in order to enable more small businesses to 
participate in the broadcast industry.  Moreover, as NPM/NCAI point out, the Commission has adopted measures in 
a separate proceeding that are intended to expand broadcast opportunities for Tribal Nations and Tribal entities.  Id.
at 6-7.  To the extent that their proposal is intended to increase broadcast service to Tribal lands, we believe it is 
outside the scope of this quadrennial review proceeding.  We note that, in the Rural Radio proceeding, the 
Commission adopted a Tribal Radio Priority in order to expand the number of radio stations owned or majority 
controlled by federally recognized American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Villages, or Tribal consortia, 
broadcasting to Tribal lands.  See Policies to Promote Rural Radio Service and to Streamline Allotment and 
Assignment Procedures, First Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making, 25 FCC Rcd 1583

However, this has no bearing on our conclusion that the standard will help promote small business and 
new entrant participation in the broadcast industry.
283. Our decision to reinstate the revenue-based eligible entity standard is also supported by 
the Commission�s own records, which indicate that a significant number of broadcast licensees and 
permittees availed themselves of policies based on the revenue-based eligible entity standard between the 
implementation of that standard and its suspension following Prometheus II. One of those policies was to 
allow an eligible entity that acquired an expiring broadcast construction permit to obtain additional time 
to build out its facilities in certain circumstances.848 In the FNPRM, we noted that many small businesses 
made use of this measure.  Our records at the time indicated that Commission staff processed 
approximately 247 Form 314 construction permit assignment applications in which the assignee self-
identified as an eligible entity during the period this measure was in use.849 Those 247 initial applications 
resulted in the construction and operation of at least 132 new broadcast facilities.850 A more recent review
of our records indicates that nearly all of these stations remain on the air.  Based on a recent staff review, 
of the 132 new stations that were built and commenced operation, 118 stations (approximately 89.4 
percent) were still operating and an additional three eligible entities that previously were not licensed or 
had not built out their facilities had since been licensed.851 In addition to the 247 Form 314 applications 
that sought Commission consent to the assignment of a construction permit to an eligible entity, our 
records indicate that during the relevant period Commission staff processed 21 Form 315 construction 
permit transfer of control applications in which the transferee self-identified as an eligible entity.852 All 
but one of these facilities (95.2 percent) were constructed following approval of the transfer of control

848 See Diversity Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5930-31, paras. 15-16; see also 47 CFR � 73.3598(a) (�An eligible entity 
that acquires an issued and outstanding construction permit for a station in any of the services listed in this 
paragraph shall have the time remaining on the construction permit or eighteen months from the consummation of 
the assignment or transfer of control, whichever is longer, within which to complete construction and file an 
application for license.�).  
849 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4489-90, para. 269.  FCC Form 314 requires that assignees in broadcast transactions 
indicate whether the assignee is an eligible entity as that term is defined in the Diversity Order.  FCC Form 314, 
Application for Consent to Assignment of Broadcast Station Construction Permit or License, Section III � Assignee, 
Question 6(d), (e)(A)-(B), http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form314/314.pdf.  Specifically, the assignee must include 
a detailed showing demonstrating proof of status as an eligible entity.
850 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4489-90, para. 269.  Eleven (4.5 percent) of the eligible entities were not yet licensed or 
had not built out the facilities specified on their construction permits, and at the time 104 of the construction permits 
held by eligible entities had been cancelled for various reasons.  Id.
851 Based on staff analysis of CDBS data as of August 25, 2015, the data reveal that 109 (90.1 percent) of these 121 
stations are FM stations; 10 (8.3 percent) are AM stations; one (0.8 percent) is a digital TV station; and one (0.8 
percent) is an FM translator station.  Moreover, 82 (67.8 percent) of these stations are noncommercial educational 
(NCE) stations.  We note that in the past NCE licensees have not been required to report information concerning the 
race, gender, or ethnicity of individuals who hold attributable interests in NCE stations.  As discussed above, in 
January we updated our reporting requirements for NCE stations to more closely parallel the requirements for 
commercial broadcast stations, including by requiring that NCE licensees report race, gender, and ethnicity 
information for attributable interest holders in NCE stations.  Form 323/CORES Report and Order.  
852 Similar to Form 314, FCC Form 315 requires that transferees in broadcast transactions indicate whether the 
transferee is an eligible entity as that term is defined in the Diversity Order.  FCC Form 315, Application for 
Consent to Transfer Control of Entity Holding Broadcast Station Construction Permit or License, Section IV �

and are now on the air.853  
284. The data clearly suggest that providing additional time to construct broadcast facilities 
has facilitated market entry by small broadcasters.  Further, we note that the data reflect the use of the 
prior eligible entity standard in a limited context and do not reflect the total number of applicants and 
permittees that benefited from all the various broadcast policies that relied on the revenue-based eligible
entity standard.  Even so, this information supports our conclusion that the revenue-based eligible entity 
standard has been used successfully by a significant number of small firms and has not only aided their 
entry, but also contributed to the sustained presence of small firms in broadcasting in furtherance of our 
public interest goals.  
285. In addition to reinstating the revenue-based eligible entity standard, we believe it is in the 
public interest to apply the standard to the full range of construction, licensing, transaction, and auction 
measures to which it previously applied.  AWM and NAB support reinstatement of these measures,854 and 
DCS has urged the Commission to reinstate the measures concerning construction permit deadlines and 
transfers of grandfathered radio station combinations.855 Commenters that have argued against 
reinstatement have done so based on whether the measures will specifically increase minority and female 
ownership of broadcast stations,856 which again has no bearing on whether the measures will promote 
small business participation in the broadcast industry.  Accordingly, the Commission hereby re-adopts 
each measure relying on this definition that was remanded in Prometheus II.  Specifically, we reinstate 
the following measures:  (1) Revision of Rules Regarding Construction Permit Deadlines;857 (2) 
Modification of Attribution Rule;858 (3) Distress Sale Policy;859 (4) Duopoly Priority for Companies that 
  
853 One of these 21 construction permits was cancelled.  Of the 20 stations that have been built and are operating, 11 
(55 percent) are FM stations; seven (35 percent) are AM stations; one (5 percent) is a low-power FM station; and 
one (5 percent) is a low-power TV station.  All but one of these stations are commercial stations.  FCC staff analysis

construction permit to an eligible entity that pledges to build out the permit within the time remaining in the original 
construction permit or within 18 months, whichever period is greater); see also 47 CFR � 73.3598(a).  In reinstating 
this measure, the Commission emphasizes that this exception to our strict broadcast station construction policy is 
limited to one 18-month extension based on one assignment to an eligible entity.  
858 Diversity Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5936, para. 31 (relaxing the equity/debt plus (EDP) attribution standard for 
interest holders in eligible entities by �allow[ing] the holder of an equity or debt interest in a media outlet subject to 
the media ownership rules to exceed the 33 percent threshold set forth in [the EDP standard] without triggering 
attribution where such investment would enable an eligible entity to acquire a broadcast station provided (1) the 
combined equity and debt of the interest holder in the eligible entity is less than 50 percent, or (2) the total debt of 
the interest holder in the eligible entity does not exceed 80 percent of the asset value of the station being acquired by 
the eligible entity and the interest holder does not hold any equity interest, option, or promise to acquire an equity 
interest in the eligible entity or any related entity�); see also 47 CFR � 73.3555, Note 2(i)(2).  In addition, pursuant 
to the new entrant bidding credits available under the Commission�s broadcast auction rules, the modified EDP 
attribution standard was available to interest holders in eligible entities that are the winning bidders in broadcast 
auctions.  See 47 CFR � 73.5008(c)(2).  We also reinstate this application of the modified EDP standard.

Finance or Incubate an Eligible Entity;860 (5) Extension of Divestiture Deadline in Certain Mergers;861 and 
(6) Assignment or Transfer of Grandfathered Radio Station Combinations.862 Moreover, to ensure 
realization of our policy goals, in reviewing the sale of a permit to an eligible entity, we will assess the 
bona fides of both the arms-length structure of the transaction and the assignee�s status as an eligible 
entity as proposed in the FNPRM.863 In addition, we clarify that this exception to our broadcast station 
construction policy applies both to original construction permits for the construction of new stations and 
to construction permits for major modifications of authorized broadcast facilities.864 We also lift any prior 
suspension of Commission rules implementing these measures and applying the eligible entity standard.865  
286. Consistent with the Commission�s pre-existing eligible entity definition, we define an 
eligible entity as any entity�commercial or noncommercial�that would qualify as a small business 
consistent with SBA standards for its industry grouping, based on revenue.866 For all SBA programs, a 
radio or television station with no more than $38.5 million in annual revenue currently is considered a 
small business.867 To determine qualification as a small business, the SBA considers the revenues of 
domestic and foreign affiliates, including the parent corporation and affiliates of the parent corporation, 
not just the revenues of individual broadcast stations.868 We will also require an eligible entity to satisfy 
one of several control tests to ensure that ultimate control rests in an entity that satisfies the revenue 
criteria.  Specifically, the eligible entity must hold:  (1) 30 percent or more of the stock/partnership shares

entities within the scope of the term �eligible entity� to the extent that they otherwise meet the criteria of this 
standard.  In the FNPRM, we sought comment on whether to use different eligible entity definitions for commercial

C. Remand Review of a Race- or Gender-Conscious Eligible Entity Standard
1. Background 
a. Prometheus II and the NPRM
287. Our adoption of a revenue-based definition of eligible entity to promote small business 
participation in the broadcast industry does not, of course, preclude us from considering whether to adopt 
an additional standard designed specifically to promote minority and female ownership of broadcast 
stations.  The Third Circuit in Prometheus II instructed the Commission to consider the other eligible 
entity definitions it had proposed when it adopted the revenue-based definition in the Third Diversity 
FNPRM, including a proposal based on the SDB definition employed by SBA.870 The NPRM sought 
comment on the benefits and risks of adopting an SDB standard, which expressly would recognize the 
race and ethnicity of applicants.  The NPRM also solicited input on other proposals that were included in 
the Third Diversity FNPRM and any other race- or gender-conscious standards the Commission should 
consider.871
288. In response to the NPRM, a number of commenters supported the adoption of a race- or 
gender-conscious standard as a means to increase minority and female ownership of broadcast stations.872  
Commenters asserted that, based on Prometheus II, the Commission must fully consider the feasibility of 
adopting an SDB standard in this proceeding and is not permitted to defer consideration of race- or 
gender-based action until a future proceeding.873  Some commenters also asserted that, prior to the 
conclusion of this proceeding, the Commission must provide any further data and complete any additional 
empirical studies that may be necessary to evaluate or justify the adoption of an SDB standard.874  
  
869 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4491-92, para. 272; Diversity Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5925-26, para. 6 n.14 (citing 2002 
Biennial Review Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 13811, para. 489).  When the Commission, in the 2002 Biennial Review 
Order, ruled that licensees would be allowed to transfer grandfathered station combinations to eligible entities, it 
required that control of the eligible entity purchasing the grandfathered combination must meet one of several 
control tests, as stated above, to meet the Commission�s public interest objectives and ensure that the benefits of the 
exception flowed as intended.  See 2002 Biennial Review Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 13811, para. 489.  We readopt these 
requirements for the same reasons.
870 Prometheus II, 652 F.3d at 471-72.  The Third Circuit specifically instructed the Commission to consider the 
alternative eligibility standards it had proposed in the Diversity Order �before it completes its 2010 Quadrennial 
Review.�  Id. at 471.

Report Comments at 4, 10, 27.  Several commenters further argued that the Commission�s 2012 323 Report does not 
satisfy the Third Circuit�s directive for the Commission to fully consider the feasibility of adopting an SDB 
standard.  See UCC et al. 2012 323 Report Comments at 10-16; NHMC 2012 323 Report Comments at 4-5.

Similarly, several commenters asked the Commission not to make any changes to any of the media 
ownership rules until it collects and analyzes data on broadcast ownership by women and minorities in a 
manner that they view as consistent with the court�s remand of the eligible entity standard.875
289. Several commenters further seemed to assert that Prometheus II not only obligates the 
Commission to consider fully the feasibility of implementing a race-conscious eligible entity standard in 
this proceeding, but also requires the Commission to adopt such a standard.876 However, other 
commenters suggested that the Commission currently lacks evidence sufficient to implement a race- or 
gender-targeted standard.877 In light of this perceived deficiency, one commenter suggested that the 
Commission promptly implement an ODP standard, which the commenter described as race- and gender-
neutral, while the Commission develops the record necessary to adopt a constitutionally sustainable race-
conscious definition.878  The ODP proposal is based on a recommendation from the Diversity Advisory 
Committee that the Commission initiate a rulemaking proceeding to design, adopt, and implement a new 
preference in its competitive bidding process that would award bidding credits to persons or entities that 
demonstrate that they have overcome significant disadvantage.879
b. The FNPRM
290. In the FNPRM, we rejected assertions that the Commission is required to adopt an SBD 
standard or another race- or gender-conscious eligible entity standard in this proceeding based on 
Prometheus II.880 We also rejected commenters� arguments that the Commission is not permitted to 
conclude this quadrennial review proceeding until we have completed any and all studies or analyses that

DCS opined that most minorities seeking ownership in the broadcast industry likely will fit within the SBA�s 
definitions of a socially and economically disadvantaged business or individual. Id. Citing the current low levels of

might enable us to take such action in the future consistent with current standards of constitutional law.881  
291. The FNRPM also provided a detailed discussion of the constitutional analysis that would 
apply to any race- or gender-conscious measure that the Commission might adopt.882 The FNPRM first 
set forth a constitutional analysis of the Commission�s interest in enhancing viewpoint diversity.  We 
noted that a race-conscious eligible entity standard would be subject to strict constitutional scrutiny and 
that, under strict scrutiny, such a standard must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and 
narrowly tailored to further that interest.883  
292. Based on our preliminary analysis, we tentatively concluded that we did not have 
sufficient evidence to satisfy the constitutional tests that would apply to an SDB standard or any other 
race- or gender-conscious eligible entity standard that the Commission might adopt.884 While we 
tentatively concluded that a reviewing court could deem the Commission�s interest in promoting a 
diversity of viewpoints compelling, we tentatively concluded that the record evidence did not demonstrate 
that adoption of race-conscious measures would be narrowly tailored to further that interest.885 We also 
tentatively found that the record did not reveal a feasible means of conducting the type of individualized 
consideration that the Supreme Court would be likely to require in order for a race-conscious measure to 
pass constitutional muster under strict scrutiny.886  
293. We noted that gender-based diversity measures would be evaluated under an intermediate 
standard of review and upheld as constitutional if the government�s actions are deemed substantially 
related to the achievement of an important objective.887 We tentatively concluded that the record evidence 
does not establish a relationship between female ownership and viewpoint diversity that is as substantial 
as the Supreme Court is likely to require under intermediate scrutiny.888   
294. We also identified significant issues that would need to be resolved prior to the 
implementation of an ODP standard�as had been proposed by DCS�such as (1) what social or 
economic disadvantages should be cognizable under an ODP standard, (2) how the Commission could

Further, we noted that the Commission may lack the resources necessary to conduct the type of 
individualized consideration that an ODP standard would require and that the Commission would have 
difficulty fully evaluating the potential diversity contributions of individual applicants without running 
afoul of First Amendment values.891  
295. The FNPRM also provided a detailed constitutional analysis of the Commission�s interest 
in remedying past discrimination.  We tentatively concluded that the record contained some evidence that 
would support a finding of discrimination in the broadcast industry but that the evidence was not of 
sufficient weight to satisfy the constitutional standards that apply to race- and gender-based remedial 
measures.892 In particular, we tentatively found that there was no evidence in the record demonstrating a 
statistically significant disparity between the number of minority- and women-owned broadcast stations 
and the number of qualified minority- and women-owned firms.  We tentatively concluded that we could 
not demonstrate a compelling interest in remedying discrimination in the Commission�s licensing process 
in the absence of such evidence.893 We sought comment on these issues and our preliminary analysis, 
including any other factors or relevant precedent that we should consider.
296. As discussed in greater detail below, many commenters continue to support the adoption 
of a race- or gender-conscious eligible entity standard as a means of increasing minority and female 
ownership of broadcast stations.894 While many commenters are critical of the Commission�s analysis in 
the FNPRM, they generally do not provide additional evidence or new analysis that would support a 
departure from our tentative conclusion in the FNPRM that we cannot, as matters stand, adopt race- or 
gender-conscious measures.  Nor do they propose specific, executable studies that plausibly might 
generate evidence that would support the adoption of race- or gender-conscious measures. 
2. Discussion  
297. We decline to adopt an SDB eligibility standard or other race- or gender-conscious 
eligible entity standard.  As we further discuss below, we have studied this issue repeatedly and find that 
there is no evidence in the record that is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standards to adopt race- or 
gender-conscious measures.  And no commenter has proposed actionable study designs that would likely 
provide the evidence necessary to support race- and/or gender-conscious measures.  While we find that a 
reviewing court could find the Commission�s interest in promoting a diversity of viewpoints over 
broadcast media compelling, we do not believe that the record evidence sufficiently demonstrates that 
adoption of race-conscious measures would be narrowly tailored to further that interest.  In particular, we 
find that the evidence in the record, including the numerous studies that have been conducted or 
submitted, does not demonstrate a connection between minority ownership and viewpoint diversity that is 
direct and substantial enough to satisfy strict scrutiny.  The two recent studies that directly address the 
impact of minority ownership on viewpoint diversity find almost no statistically significant relationship

to directly support industry entry by minorities akin to policies such as the former minority tax certificate, minority 
distress sale policy, and the minority credit in comparative hearings.  NABOB FNPRM Comments at 4, 6.  It asserts 
that from 1934 to 1978, when the Commission had no such specific policies, there was very little minority broadcast 
station ownership; from 1978 to 1995, the Commission had such policies and minority ownership saw rapid growth, 
asserts NABOB.  Thereafter, following suspension of these policies, NABOB asserts, minority broadcast ownership 
experienced a severe decline.  Id. at 4.  As discussed above, however, NABOB�s assertion that minority ownership 
has experienced a severe decline is contrary to the record evidence.  See supra paras. 77, 126.

between such ownership and their measure of viewpoint diversity.895 Other studies in the record examine 
the relationship between minority ownership and other aspects of our diversity goal, such as programming 
or format diversity, rather than the viewpoint diversity that the Supreme Court has recognized as an 
interest �of the highest order� and that the Commission believes is most central to First Amendment 
values.896 Many of the studies, too, demonstrate at most a limited relationship between minority 
ownership and other aspects of our diversity goal.897  
298. In addition, we do not believe that the record evidence establishes a sufficiently strong 
relationship between diversity of viewpoint and female ownership of broadcast stations that would satisfy 
the constitutional standards for gender-based classifications.  We find that the evidence in the record does 
not reveal that the content provided via women-owned broadcast stations substantially contributes to 
viewpoint diversity in a manner different from other stations or otherwise varies significantly from that 
provided by other stations.898 Because the studies in the record do not indicate that increased female 
ownership will increase viewpoint diversity, we believe that they do not provide a rationale for adopting 
gender-based diversity measures.899  
299. Moreover, we do not believe that the record evidence is sufficient to establish a 
compelling interest in remedying past discrimination.  We find that there is no evidence in the record 
demonstrating a statistically significant disparity between the number of minority- and women-owned 
broadcast stations and the number of qualified minority- and women-owned firms, and we lack a 
plausible way to determine the number of qualified firms owned by minorities and women.900 We believe 
that we cannot demonstrate a compelling interest in remedying discrimination in the Commission�s 
licensing process in the absence of such evidence.901 Because the only statistical evidence in the record 
pertains to discriminatory access to capital and the rest is anecdotal evidence that is of more limited value 
for purposes of satisfying heightened scrutiny, we find that the record evidence of past discrimination in 
the broadcast industry�both by the Commission itself and by private parties with the Commission acting 
as a passive participant�is not nearly as substantial as that accepted by courts in other contexts as 
satisfying strict scrutiny.902 Accordingly, we cannot adopt rules that explicitly rely on race or gender.903

intermediate scrutiny.  See infra note 947.  Based on our evaluation of the record evidence, we also conclude that it 
is not of sufficient weight to support gender-based remedial action.  See infra Section IV.C.2.b.
903 The FNPRM also contains a detailed and thorough analysis of these issues, and it reflects the Commission�s 
extensive efforts to evaluate the current constitutional considerations and available evidence regarding the adoption 
of race- and gender-conscious measures.

survive the first prong of the strict scrutiny test, and we sought comment on this analysis.904 In response 
to the FNPRM, many commenters agree that the Commission�s interest in promoting viewpoint diversity 
could be deemed sufficiently compelling under strict scrutiny, and we affirm this belief.905 The U.S. 
Supreme Court to date has accepted only two justifications for race-based action as compelling for 
purposes of strict scrutiny:  student body diversity in higher education and remedying past 
discrimination.906 In Metro Broadcasting, the Court held, based on the application of intermediate 
constitutional scrutiny, that �the interest in enhancing broadcast diversity is, at the very least, an important 
governmental objective.�907 However, the D.C. Circuit held in Lutheran Church that broadcast diversity 
does not rise to the level of a compelling governmental interest.908 Also, in 2007, the Supreme Court 
declined to recognize a compelling interest in diversity outside of �the context of higher education.�909 In 
the FNPRM, we tentatively found that the case law nevertheless supports our position that viewpoint 
diversity would be found to be compelling�even though the law is unsettled.910 Regardless of whether 
viewpoint diversity is a compelling interest, however, we find that we still cannot adopt an SDB 
eligibility standard or other race- or gender-conscious eligibility standard, as discussed below.  
301. Assuming a reviewing court could be convinced that diversity of viewpoint is a 
compelling governmental interest, we find that the record in this proceeding fails to satisfy the second 
prong of the strict scrutiny test, i.e., that there is a sufficient nexus between minority ownership of 
broadcast stations and viewpoint diversity.  As we explained in the FNPRM, the two recent studies in the 
record that directly address the impact of minority ownership on viewpoint diversity find almost no 
statistically significant relationship between such ownership and their measure of viewpoint diversity.911  
Also, consistent with the FNPRM, we find that the body of evidence contained in the other 2010 Media 
Ownership Studies and the studies that commenters submitted in this proceeding largely concerns 
program or format diversity rather than viewpoint diversity, which we believe is the only kind of diversity 
likely to be accepted as a compelling governmental interest under strict scrutiny.912 Moreover, as

explained in the FNPRM, many of those studies support only limited conclusions.913 Although we invited 
commenters to provide additional evidence and other information that might be relevant to our analysis, 
some commenters merely dispute our assessment of known evidence, rather than submit additional 
information that we did not consider in the FNPRM.914 We reject claims that, in tentatively finding that 
the evidence in the record does not demonstrate the requisite connection between minority ownership and 
viewpoint diversity, we relied on dissenting opinions to establish �an artificial and unofficial standard� 
for narrow tailoring or evaluated the record evidence inconsistently in order to �minimize� evidence of a 
connection between minority ownership and viewpoint diversity.915 To the contrary, our narrow tailoring 
analysis included a discussion of relevant judicial precedent, and our tentative findings were based on a 
careful reading of that precedent, taken as a whole, and our assessment of the body of evidence in this

study commissioned by the Benton Foundation in the context of a strict scrutiny analysis would be limited because it 
covered only three neighborhoods in one metropolitan area); id. at 4503-04, para. 297 (noting that the Turner Radio 
Study and Turner/Cooper TV Study commissioned by Free Press offer only limited analyses of the content provided 
by minority stations and do not provide any definitive analysis of viewpoint diversity issues).  Commenters have not 
submitted any studies in this proceeding that provide the type of evidence that we previously indicated we believe 
would be necessary to satisfy the constitutional standards that apply to race- and gender-conscious measures.  See 
FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4500-05, paras. 289-98 (evaluating the record evidence and tentatively finding that it does 
not demonstrate the �nearly complete� or �tightly bound� nexus between diversity of viewpoint and minority 
ownership that would be required to justify a race-based eligible entity definition); id. at 4508, para. 301 (tentatively 
finding that record evidence does not demonstrate that the content provided via women-owned broadcast stations 
substantially contributes to viewpoint diversity in a manner different from other stations or otherwise varies 
significantly from that provided by other stations); infra paras. 304, 308.
914 As discussed below, however, these commenters generally seem to accept our view that the record evidence does 
not provide a sufficient basis for the Commission to adopt race-conscious measures that will withstand strict 
scrutiny.  See infra para. 304.  
915 See AAJC FNPRM Comments at 14-15; UCC/Common Cause FNPRM Reply at 6-14. See also AAJC FNPRM 
Comments at 15 (asserting that it is premature for the Commission to affirm its tentative conclusions on narrow 
tailoring without knowing �how it will actually implement race-conscious policies�); NABOB FNPRM Comments 
at 12-13 (asserting that the FNPRM identifies several studies that �clearly demonstrate� that minority audiences 
prefer minority programming and that based upon this measure, the Commission has a substantial amount of 
evidence demonstrating that minority ownership leads to viewpoint diversity); UCC/Common Cause FNPRM Reply 
at 14 (�AAJC correctly explains that, without a specific policy before [it], it is impossible for the Commission to use 
the four-prong Grutter test to evaluate [whether race-conscious measures would be narrowly tailored to further the 
Commission�s interest in viewpoint diversity].�); UCC et al. FNPRM Comments at 25 (asserting that it is premature 
for the Commission to affirm its tentative conclusions on narrow tailoring).  We disagree with assertions that it is 
premature for the Commission to reach any conclusions on narrow tailoring.  The Third Circuit directed the 
Commission to consider the SDB eligibility standard and other eligible entity definitions proposed in the Third 
Diversity FNPRM, and we are complying with the court�s instruction based on an extensive analysis of applicable 
judicial precedent and available empirical evidence.  
In addition to criticizing the FNPRM�s assessment of the record evidence and the applicable evidentiary standard, 
UCC/Common Cause also criticize the FNPRM for �ask[ing] whether a theory of viewpoint diversity or remediation 
is viable, when in fact the Commission would likely need to pursue several legal theories jointly to succeed.�  
UCC/Common Cause FNPRM Reply at 12.  Because of the �complex relationships,� the unique role of broadcasting 
in the U.S., and the nature of scholarship in this area, the Commission should consider �the cumulative justifications 
of viewpoint diversity, remediation, and the additional compelling interests that are also impacted by broadcasting,� 
assert UCC/Common Cause.  UCC/Common Cause FNPRM Reply at 12.  As we explained in the FNPRM and 
continue to believe, we do not believe that any interest other than viewpoint diversity or remediation of 
discrimination (if established by the record) would be found to be a compelling governmental interest sufficient to 
satisfy the first prong of the strict scrutiny test.  And we know of no case law, nor does UCC/Common Cause cite 
any, which analyzes justifications for race-conscious action on a �cumulative� basis.  Consequently, we reject 
UCC/Common Cause�s suggestion.

proceeding.916 We find no reason in the present record to depart from that analysis.  Other commenters 
suggest additional topics that they believe the Commission should study but do not propose specific, 
executable studies or claim that the additional inquiries they propose would establish the requisite nexus 
between minority ownership and viewpoint diversity.917  
302. Moreover, while we find that the Hispanic Television Study is an important contribution 
to the study of the impact of ownership on programming and viewership, we do not believe that the 
study�s findings materially impact our constitutional analysis.  Given the scope of the study (i.e., 
examining the nexus between ownership, programming, and viewing), many of the study�s findings do 
not inform our viewpoint diversity analysis specifically, which focuses primarily on local news and public 
affairs programming.  However, certain findings were instructive.  Notably, the study found evidence 
suggesting that Hispanic viewers watch local, Spanish-language news at higher levels than English-
language news and that Hispanic ownership is associated with local, Spanish-language news 
programming.918 The study cautions that these results are only suggestive and that limitations in the data 
(such as the small sample size of Hispanic-owned stations) makes it difficult to identify statistically 
significant results.919 Accordingly, while the study is a useful addition to the research into these issues, 
the suggestive results are insufficient for a final conclusion of the relationships examined.920 Therefore, 
we do not believe that the study changes our constitutional analysis, though it has helped inform the study 
of these issues.  Indeed, commenters generally agree with our assessment that the study has not provided 
a basis for the Commission to adopt race-conscious measures.921
303. Some commenters disagree with our analysis of case law involving judicial review of 
race-based classifications, as discussed above, but they do not cite any precedent that we did not consider 
in the FNPRM.  As we explained there, we believe that empirical evidence of a stronger nexus between 
minority ownership and viewpoint diversity than was demonstrated in Metro Broadcasting would be 
required in order for a race-conscious rule to withstand strict scrutiny.922 We are not persuaded by Asian 
Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC)�s assertions to the contrary, which we believe are substantially the 
same as those we considered and rejected in the FNPRM.923  
304. And while some commenters disagree with the sufficiency of our efforts to study the 
connection between minority ownership and viewpoint diversity, the evidence in the record, our 
assessment of the evidence, and the applicable evidentiary standard in this proceeding,924 they generally 
seem to accept our view that the evidence is not sufficient to enable the Commission to adopt race-based 
measures.  For instance, NABOB acknowledges that additional studies may not provide evidence that 
could support race-conscious measures and �therefore [the Commission] cannot promise to create a

policy that is specifically designed to promote minority ownership.�925 Similarly, UCC et al. suggest that 
the record evidence does not provide a sufficient basis for the Commission to adopt a race-conscious 
eligibility standard.926 Other commenters also seem to concede, implicitly or explicitly, that the evidence 
in the present record is insufficient to support race-conscious action by the Commission.927  
305. In addition, we continue to believe that implementing a program for awarding or 
affording preferences related to broadcast licenses based on the �individualized review� that the Supreme 
Court has required under strict scrutiny would pose a number of significant administrative and practical 
challenges for the Commission and would not be feasible.  As we explained in the FNPRM, where race-
conscious governmental action is concerned, the Supreme Court previously has found that narrow 
tailoring requires individualized review, serious, good-faith consideration of race-neutral alternatives, 
minimal adverse impacts on third parties, and temporal limits.928  In particular, the Court found in Grutter 
that narrow tailoring demands that race be considered �in a flexible, non-mechanical way� alongside 
other factors that may contribute to diversity and that consideration of race was permissible only as one 
among many disparate factors in order to evaluate individual applicants for admission to an educational 
institution.929 We find that the manner in which the Commission allocates broadcast licenses differs from 
university admissions in many important respects.  For instance, the process of acquiring a new 
commercial broadcast license is dictated by statute and involves a highly structured, open, and 
competitive bidding process.930 Individuals or entities must enter bids for broadcast allotments�a 
market-based regime�and must offer the highest monetary value for the allotment in order to acquire a 
construction permit.931 As we explained in the FNPRM, we believe that this framework does not lend

itself to the type of case-by-case consideration envisioned by Grutter.932 Although the FNPRM sought 
comment on potential ways in which an individualized review process could be incorporated feasibly,
effectively, and efficiently into any race-conscious measures adopted by the Commission, no commenter 
has offered such a proposal, nor has the Commission been able to develop one.  Therefore, we conclude 
that the record reveals no feasible means of carrying out the type of individualized consideration that the 
Supreme Court has required under strict scrutiny.933

subject to heightened review under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause, we decline 
to adopt the proposed ODP standard in the absence of a feasible means of implementing such a standard 
without running afoul of First Amendment values.  Several commenters express general support for the 
proposed ODP standard but none have proposed a method for the Commission to provide the type of 
individualized consideration that an ODP standard would require without being unduly resource-intensive 
and inconsistent with First Amendment values.  Commenters also have not addressed other specific issues 
that the FNPRM indicated would need to be resolved prior to implementation of the ODP proposal.935 In 
particular, no commenter has proposed a means for the Commission to validate claims of eligibility for 
ODP status.  Based on available information about the proposal, we believe that validating a claim of

933 UCC/Common Cause assert that the FNPRM confines its consideration of the proposed ODP standard to the 
Commission�s viewpoint diversity interest without considering whether the proposed ODP standard could be applied 
as a remedial measure.  UCC/Common Cause FNPRM Reply at 13.  We disagree.  The administrative, practical, and 
First Amendment issues that we have identified would need to be resolved prior to the implementation of an ODP 
standard regardless of whether that standard is used to further the Commission�s interest in viewpoint diversity or 
remedy past or present discrimination.  See supra paras. 293, 305.  Moreover, as we discuss below, we do not 
believe that available evidence of discrimination in the broadcast industry is of sufficient weight to demonstrate a 
compelling interest in remedying discrimination in the Commission�s broadcast licensing process.  See infra Section 
IV.C.2.b.
Contrary to the assertions of UCC/Common Cause, the FNPRM did not tentatively conclude that the Commission 
�must emulate university admissions in order to pursue viewpoint diversity.�  UCC/Common Cause FNPRM Reply 
at 13; see Letter from Cheryl A. Leanza, Policy Advisor, UCC, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, at 2 (filed 
May 25, 2016) (UCC May 25, 2016 Ex Parte Letter).  Rather, the FNPRM noted that the Supreme Court relied in 
part on the concept of �critical mass� to find the requisite nexus between student body diversity and race-based 
admissions and that this concept is not easily transferable to broadcasting.  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4504, n.905.
934 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4506-07, para. 300.  See, e.g., Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 912-13 (1995) (facially 
race-neutral electoral districting plan triggers strict scrutiny if predominantly motivated by racial concerns); Vill. of 
Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66 (1997) (developer failed to carry its burden of

assert simply that increasing university�s reliance on facially neutral component of admissions policy would make it

�mischaracterized� the ODP standard as a race-conscious measure that would be subject to heightened scrutiny.  
MMTC FNPRM Comments at 5-6.  We disagree.  The FNPRM did not describe the proposed ODP standard as a 
race-conscious measure.  Rather, the FNPRM noted that it is not entirely clear whether the proposed ODP standard 
would be subject to heightened constitutional scrutiny.  FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4506, para. 300 & n.915; see

criteria, yet is constructed for the purpose of promoting minority ownership, might be subject to heightened scrutiny.

eligibility for ODP status would require a finding that the applicant has faced and overcome a �substantial 
disadvantage��a determination that inherently would be prone to some degree of subjectivity�as well 
as a finding that the applicant would likely contribute to viewpoint diversity by virtue of him or her facing 
and overcoming a substantial disadvantage.  We do not believe that there is a means for the Commission 
to administer such a program in a manner that is sufficiently objective and consistent,936 and that would 
ensure that the Commission does not evaluate applicants based on a subjective determination as to 
whether a particular applicant would be likely to contribute to viewpoint diversity.937 In addition, no 
commenter has offered input on (1) what social or economic disadvantages should be cognizable under an 
ODP standard,938 (2) whether applicants should bear the burden of proving specifically that they would 
contribute to diversity as a result of having overcome certain disadvantages, (3) how the Commission 
could measure the overcoming of a disadvantage if an applicant is a widely held corporation rather than 
an entity with a single majority shareholder or a small number of control persons, and (4) how the 
Commission could evaluate the effectiveness of the use of an ODP standard.  Accordingly, we are not 
adopting the proposed ODP standard.      
307. Gender-Based Diversity Measures.  Gender-based measures are subject to a less 
restrictive Constitutional standard�intermediate scrutiny�than race-based measures.  Under 
intermediate scrutiny, a gender-based classification must be substantially related to the achievement of an 
important objective.939 While Metro Broadcasting established that viewpoint diversity is at least an 
important government objective, Lamprecht v. FCC found that available evidence failed to demonstrate a 
statistically meaningful link between ownership of broadcast stations by women and programming of any 
kind.940 As a result, the D.C. Circuit, in Lamprecht, overturned the Commission�s former gender 
preference policy.941 In order to overcome Lamprecht, the Commission must be able to establish the 
requisite connection between viewpoint diversity and ownership by women; however, in the FNPRM we 
stated that, based on our evaluation of relevant studies, we did not believe there was evidence to 
demonstrate that the content provided via women-owned broadcast stations substantially contributes to 
viewpoint diversity in a manner different from other stations or otherwise varies significantly from that 
  
936 See, e.g., Auction Preference Public Notice, 25 FCC Rcd at 16864 (Diversity Advisory Committee 
Recommendation on Preference for Overcoming Disadvantage) (�Importantly, a qualifying disadvantage would 
have to be �substantial.�  The definition of what constitutes a substantial disadvantage would be addressed in the 
rulemaking and would be further refined on a case-by-case basis.  To the extent possible, it is desirable to reduce 
subjectivity and achieve consistency among individualized determinations.�); id. at 16864-65 (�This requirement 
does not contemplate that successful applicants necessarily will have fully and finally overcome the disadvantages 
they faced. . . .  The degree of success required to show that a disadvantage has been sufficiently overcome would be 
further refined in a rulemaking and case-by-case determinations.�).
937 See Metro Broad., 497 U.S. at 585 n.36 (noting that the Commission eschews involvement in licensees�

provided by other stations.942  
308. In response to the FNPRM, UCC et al. question the tentative conclusion that women-
controlled stations do not substantially contribute to viewpoint diversity in a manner that differs from 
other stations or otherwise varies significantly from that provided by other stations, arguing that the 
Commission has done little to no research on this issue.943 Commenters, however, did not provide any 
additional evidence, studies, proposed study designs, or other information that is relevant to our analysis 
of this issue.  The Commission has similarly been unable to identify such evidence or devise study 
designs that are likely to provide such evidence.944 While commenters still express general support for 
gender-based initiatives,945 such support is not sufficient absent evidence to establish a connection 
between viewpoint diversity and ownership by women.  And while we acknowledge that the data show 
that women-owned stations are not represented in proportion to the presence of women in the overall 
population, we do not believe that the evidence reveals that the content provided via women-owned 
broadcast stations substantially contributes to viewpoint diversity in a manner different from other 
stations or otherwise varies significantly from that provided by other stations.946 Therefore, we conclude 
that there is insufficient evidence to satisfy the constitutional standards that apply to gender-based 
measures.   
b. Remedying Past Discrimination 
309. Similarly, we conclude that, although we have studied extensively the question, there is 
no �strong basis in evidence�947 of discrimination in the award of broadcast licenses or other 
discrimination in the broadcast industry in which the government has actively or passively participated

944 In its efforts to create specific study designs (which includes reaching out to experts in the field), the Commission 
has identified a number of issues that significantly impede study of the connection between ownership and 
viewpoint diversity. These issues include, for example, the lack of a reliable measure of viewpoint; small sample 
size; accounting for potential variations from differences in the way the data were collected rather than actual 
changes in the marketplace when combining old and new sets; and the lack of relevant data sets from before and 
after policy changes or marketplace developments (if any can be identified) that would help demonstrate causation 
regarding the impact of ownership on viewpoint diversity.

946 As we explained in the FNPRM, the only study included in the record of this proceeding that analyzes the 
relationship between female ownership and broadcast content is the Turner Radio Study, which finds that markets 
that contain radio stations with either female or minority ownership are more likely to broadcast certain progressive 
and conservative talk shows.  We do not believe that this study demonstrates a causal relationship between female or 
minority ownership and the diversity of viewpoints or content available, as it does not control for other factors that 
may explain both the presence of a greater diversity of talk shows and a higher percentage of female or minority 
ownership in certain markets.  Other studies in the record establish that female ownership of broadcast stations is 
well below the proportion of women in the population, a fact that is not in dispute in this proceeding.  See FNPRM, 
29 FCC Rcd at 4508-09, n.923.
947 Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 500 (1989).  Less evidence is required for gender-based measures, 
although an �exceedingly persuasive justification� is still necessary.  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 530; see also Eng�g 
Contractors Ass�n of S. Fla., Inc. v. Metro. Dade County, 122 F.3d 895, 909 (11th Cir 1997).  The question of 
whether governmental participation is required is unsettled.  Some courts have held that private discrimination need 
not be linked to governmental action under intermediate scrutiny.  See Concrete Works of Colo., Inc. v. City and Cty. 
of Denver, 321 F.3d 950, 959-60 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1027 (2003) (citing See Ensley Branch, NAACP

cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1033 (1992)).  As discussed in this section, we also conclude that the record evidence is not of 
sufficient weight to support gender-based remedial action.

that would satisfy the constitutional standards that apply to race- or gender-based remedial measures.  In 
the FNPRM, we noted that the Commission never has asserted a remedial interest in race-or gender-based 
broadcast regulation.948 We explained that the evidence of discrimination offered in the studies that 
commenters cited, while informative, was not nearly as substantial as that accepted by courts in other 
contexts.949  In response, commenters are generally critical of the Commission�s analysis but most do not 
cite any additional relevant precedent or data that we did not discuss in the FNPRM.950 Although 
UCC/Common Cause identify additional information that they believe is relevant to an analysis of the 
Commission�s interest in remedying past discrimination, they do not assert that such information is 
sufficient to satisfy the relevant constitutional requirements.951 We have evaluated the evidence in the 
record, and we find that it is not of sufficient weight to support race- or gender-based remedial measures. 
310. We disagree with UCC/Common Cause�s assertion that we raised the bar in our remedial 
interest tentative conclusions and that we incorrectly rejected or ignored evidence of discrimination in the 
broadcast industry.952 Rather than rejecting evidence because it does not prove that the Commission itself 
has engaged in discrimination, the FNPRM tentatively found that existing evidence of past discrimination 
is not nearly as substantial in this case as the evidence that courts have required in other contexts.  In 
particular, we noted the absence of evidence demonstrating a statistically significant disparity between the 
number of minority- and women-owned broadcast stations and the number of qualified minority- and 
women-owned firms.  We asked commenters to address whether evidence of a statistically significant 
disparity between the number of minority- and women-owned broadcast stations and the number of 
qualified minority- and women-owned firms is ascertainable.  As discussed below, we find that the 
current research model employed in existing disparity studies is unlikely to produce meaningful results in
the broadcast context.953 In the FNPRM, we also observed that the only statistical evidence of 
discrimination in the record at the time pertained to discriminatory access to capital and that the rest of the 
evidence was anecdotal and therefore of more limited value in light of the heightened evidentiary

2010 Initial Comments of the Diversity and Competition Supporters,� which, according to MMTC, details �the 
Commission�s history of erecting market entry barriers that kept minorities out of the media industry and validating 
[the] discriminatory practices of segregationist licensees.�); UCC/Common Cause FNPRM Reply at 3-6 (arguing, 
inter alia, that the FNPRM incorrectly rejects the 2000 Historical Study because the study does not show that the 
Commission itself engaged in discrimination, even though such evidence is not the standard; rejects evidence of 
discrimination in the 2000 Capital Markets Study without adequately explaining why the study�s focus on non-
broadcast industry information makes it less probative of discrimination in the broadcast industry; ignores the 2000 
Auction Utilization Study, in which UCC/Common Cause believe there is evidence of discrimination in wireless 
auctions; ignores Part 3 of the 2000 Broadcast Licensing Study, in which UCC/Common Cause find �useful 
indicators� that might show that the Commission acted as a passive participant in private discrimination in the 
broadcast industry; wrongly states that the Commission never has asserted a remedial interest in race- or gender-
based broadcast regulation and that commenters have not focused on establishing a case for remedial measures; and 
indicates a need for a large number of studies, such as those found in Adarand, but then �dismisses the value of 
studies conducted in the 1980s�).
951 See supra note 950.  There is no inconsistency, as UCC/Common Cause claim, between our conclusion in this 
proceeding that we lack the strong basis in evidence of racial discrimination in the broadcast industry in which the 
FCC has been complicit that is necessary to adopt race-conscious remedial action and the Commission�s adoption 
of bans on discrimination in advertising contracts and in private transactions. See UCC/Common Cause FNPRM 
Reply at 3.  The latter actions are not race-conscious measures and therefore did not require an evidentiary 
foundation sufficient to withstand strict scrutiny. They were simply measures designed to combat private 
discrimination in the marketplace.

requirements of strict scrutiny.954 As we explained there, the Capital Markets Study found statistical 
evidence of discrimination in U.S. capital markets, but the study indicates that its results are not fully 
conclusive.955 Also, its focus on wireless auctions and other non-broadcast industry information makes it 
less probative of discrimination in the broadcast licensing process.956 Even considering the Capital 
Markets Study together with available anecdotal evidence in other studies,957 we find that the evidence of 
past discrimination in the Commission�s broadcast licensing process is not nearly as substantial as that 
accepted by courts in other contexts.958
311. We also disagree with suggestions that it is legally permissible for the Commission to 
infer past discrimination based on the disparity between the number of minority- and women-owned 
broadcast stations and the number of minorities and women in the general population.959 As explained in 
the FNPRM, the Supreme Court has held that an inference of discrimination may arise when there is a 
significant statistical disparity between the number of qualified minority contractors willing and able to 
perform a particular service and the number of such contractors actually engaged.960 Although UCC et al. 
suggest that no special qualifications are necessary to own a broadcast station, the Commission has long 
required that broadcast applicants meet certain character, financial, and other qualifications to operate a

participation� but do not claim that this study would enable the Commission to adopt race- or gender-based remedial 
measures that would satisfy the relevant constitutional requirements.  UCC/Common Cause Reply at 5; see KPMG

956 Id. (citing Croson, 488 U.S. at 498).  In Croson, the Supreme Court found that the factual predicate for race-
based action was deficient where, among other things, the government failed to make findings specific to the market 
to be addressed by the remedy.  488 U.S. at 498.  Because broadcasting is the industry that would be addressed if we 
were to adopt remedial measures here, and neither the 2000 Capital Markets Study nor the Auction Utilization Study 
contains conclusive findings that reveal a governmental role in discrimination in the broadcast industry, we do not 
believe these studies establish a factual predicate for race-based action that the Court would deem sufficient.  Id.; see

Auction Outcomes (2000) (Capital Markets Study); Ernst & Young LLP, FCC Econometric Analysis of Potential

Auctions (2000).     
957 See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4510-12 paras. 304-06 (discussing Capital Markets Study and studies that contain 
anecdotal evidence).
958 For instance, in Adarand v. Slater, a leading public contracting case in which the Tenth Circuit found the 
requisite strong basis in evidence, the record contained 39 studies revealing an aggregate 13 percent disparity 
between minority business availability and utilization in government contracting, a figure which the court found to 
be �significant,� if not overwhelming, evidence of discrimination.  In reaching that determination, the court relied on 
evidence of private discrimination.  The evidence was similar in nature to the evidence in this case�denial of access 
to capital, as well as the existence of exclusionary �old boy� networks and union discrimination that prevented 
access to the skills and experience needed to form a business�but it was substantially greater in extent and weight.  
The court had the benefit of a Department of Justice report, prepared in response to the Supreme Court�s decision in 
Adarand, summarizing 30 congressional hearings and numerous outside studies providing both statistical and 
anecdotal evidence of such private discrimination. See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4511, para. 306 (discussing 
Adarand v. Slater, 228 F.3d 1147 (10th Cir. 2000)).

station.961 And, of course, not all members of the population are interested in operating a broadcast 
station.  Accordingly, we do not believe that evidence of a significant statistical disparity between the 
number of minority- and women-owned broadcast stations and the number of minorities and women in 
the general population would be sufficient by itself to overcome the constitutional hurdle that has been 
established for race- and gender-based remedial measures.  Instead, we continue to believe that, absent 
evidence showing a statistically significant disparity between the number of minority- and women-owned 
broadcast stations and the number of qualified minority- and women-owned firms,962 we cannot 
demonstrate a compelling interest in remedying discrimination in the Commission�s broadcast licensing 
process.    
312. UCC/Common Cause assert that the Commission is required to fund research to identify 
whether such disparities exist.963 Based on our review of existing disparity studies, we do not believe that 
is true.  In particular, UCC/Common Cause identify no method of studying this question that would 
produce meaningful results in the broadcast context.  For existing studies, often employed in government 
contracting cases, there is generally a ready database of minority or female contractors that are willing 
and able to perform a particular service�or an established methodology to identify such contractors�
that can be compared to the number of such contractors that are actually engaged by the government.  
Indeed, in most industries one need not be a government contractor in order to operate a business that 
provides the services that the government seeks (e.g., construction or advertising).  This provides an 
ample pool of available contractors for the researchers to identify, both nationally and locally, depending 
on the nature of the program.  And Supreme Court precedent instructs that the appropriate comparison is 
to the number of qualified firms that would be interested in being engaged by the government.  However, 
there are no broadcast station owners other than those already licensed to be broadcasters, and the record 
does not reveal any method for identifying otherwise qualified firms that are not already broadcast 
licensees.  In these circumstances, there is no pool of qualified non-licensee minority- or women-owned 
broadcast firms to compare against existing minority- or women-owned broadcast stations.  Without such 
evidence or a methodology for ascertaining such evidence, we find that a disparity study similar to those 
relied on by other agencies for government contracting purposes is not feasible in the broadcast context.  
Given our determination of the infeasibility of this research, the lack of any support in the record 
indicating that it would be feasible, and the very substantial funds and time it would take to conduct it�
likely millions of dollars and several years�we do not believe it is in the public interest for the

Commission to undertake a disparity study.
c. Other Issues  
313. Several commenters state that the FNPRM falls short of what these commenters assert to 
be the Third Circuit�s directive that the Commission gather relevant ownership data and develop policies 
to address the paucity of female and minority owners among broadcast licensees.964 As we stated 
previously, we disagree with arguments that the Prometheus II decision requires that we adopt a race- or 
gender-conscious eligible entity standard in this quadrennial review proceeding or that we continue this 
proceeding until the Commission has completed whatever studies or analyses that will enable it to take 
race- or gender-conscious action in the future consistent with current standards of constitutional law.965  
By evaluating the feasibility of implementing a race- or gender-conscious eligibility standard based on an 
extensive analysis of the available evidence, we have followed the Third Circuit�s direction in 
Prometheus II and Prometheus III. We note that over the course of this proceeding, the Commission has 
performed or commissioned a dozen studies.  The FNPRM provides a detailed analysis of the relevant 
studies that were available at the time, and we discuss herein more recent evidence and pertinent 
information that commenters submitted in response to the FNPRM.966 The Third Circuit court in 
Prometheus III stated that it did not intend to prejudge the outcome of our analysis of the evidence or the 
feasibility of implementing a race- or gender-conscious standard that would be consistent both with 
applicable legal standards and the Commission�s practices and procedures.967  
314. Moreover, we do not believe that any relevant statutory directive requires the adoption of 
race- or gender-conscious measures in order to promote ownership diversity.  The Commission has 
previously determined that it has a general mandate to promote ownership diversity under Section 257 of 
the 1996 Act and Section 309(j) of the Act, which includes promoting ownership by small businesses, 
new entrants, and minority- and women-owned businesses.968 But this authority does not mandate 
specific outcomes or ownership levels or race- or gender-conscious action to foster diversity, nor does it 
permit the adoption of rules and policies that are not supported by the record or that conflict with the 
Constitution.  Therefore, we find the suggestion that the Commission is compelled, either by the Third 
Circuit or by statute, to adopt race- or gender-conscious measures to be untenable.  The Third Circuit 
ordered the Commission to make a final determination as to whether to adopt a new eligible entity 
definition (including consideration of SDB- and ODP-based definitions), and we have done so.  As 
discussed herein, the Commission continues to take significant steps to improve its ownership data and to 
promote ownership diversity, and our determination that we cannot take race- or gender-conscious action 
at this time does not mean that the Commission has failed to act appropriately in furtherance of its goal to 
promote ownership diversity. 
315. Some commenters criticize the Commission based on their perception that the 
Commission has not made a substantial effort to gather evidence that would support race- and gender-

965 See, e.g., NABOB FNPRM Comments at 15.  NABOB requests that the Commission delay the issuance of a 
report and order in this proceeding until the Commission has initiated all of the studies necessary to meet the strict 
scrutiny standard and has adopted a definition of �eligible entity� that can be used to implement rule and policy 
changes that have the potential to specifically promote minority ownership of broadcast facilities.  NABOB FNPRM 
Comments at 4, 9.  We decline to do so for the reasons discussed herein.

conscious measures.969 UCC et al. assert that it is inappropriate for the Commission to place the burden of 
providing additional evidence on commenting parties without describing what it believes is necessary to 
withstand strict scrutiny.970 As discussed above, however, the Commission has not only commissioned a 
number of studies, none of which provided it a constitutional basis to take race- or gender-conscious 
action; it has also taken a number of steps to improve the quality of its broadcast ownership data and to 
facilitate future additional studies that commenters, academics, or others believe might provide a 
constitutional basis to adopt race- and gender-conscious measures.  Further, we have provided a detailed 
and thorough analysis of what is necessary to meet the relevant constitutional standards and identified the 
reasons we believe that, having studied the question, we do not have evidence that would allow us to meet 
those standards.971  
316. In addition, while some commenters have suggested study topics or broad research 
frameworks, none has provided actionable study designs that the Commission or private researchers could 
execute.972 The Commission has expended considerable time and effort throughout the course of this 
proceeding in an effort to create such study designs; and it has commissioned or performed a dozen 
studies that it was able to develop over the course of the proceeding.973 At present, neither the record in 
this proceeding nor the Commission�s own efforts have produced additional study designs that we expect 
would develop the evidence necessary to support race- and/or gender-conscious measures.  Therefore, our 
decision today that the record does not support the adoption of race- or gender-conscious measures 
reflects the inability of the Commission and commenters�including many groups and individuals 
experienced in research methodology�to identify relevant study designs that, if implemented, would be 
likely to support such measures.  While we believe it worthwhile to continue to explore these issues and 
to monitor the relevant constitutional jurisprudence, we are exercising today our responsibility to pass on 
the race- and gender-based proposals before us at this time.  Our action today does not prevent the 
Commission from reassessing these measures in the future if changed circumstances suggest a different 
outcome.  Indeed, this decision does not preclude a different finding in the future, including the adoption

Henderson, President & CEO, LCCHR, and Nancy Zirkin, Executive Vice President, LCCHR, to Tom Wheeler, 
Chairman, FCC, at 1-3 (filed Mar. 22, 2016).  Free Press notes that an analysis of ownership diversity would be 
useful even if it fell short of justifying race- and gender-based policies.   One �basic assessment� that the 
Commission has not made is �a study of the types of market and ownership structures that correlate with women�s 
and people of color�s entry into the market, success in the market, or exit from the market.�  Free Press FNPRM 
Comments at 17; see also id. at 19 (�Assessing what types of market structures are more likely to support new 
entrants and ownership by diverse and independent owners, and promulgating Commission policy to encourage or 
mirror those structures, does not implicate equal protection issues or require strict scrutiny.�).  We disagree.  As 
discussed herein, the Commission has made significant efforts to analyze issues of ownership diversity and market 
structure.  See supra paras. 246-255, 267-270; infra para. 316 & note 973.

973 The media ownership studies commissioned by the Commission and the Commission�s Hispanic Television
Study are instructive examples of the type of study design that is required to effectively analyze issues of ownership 
and viewpoint, which includes identifying a question, a data set that permits analysis of the question, defining key 
concepts (e.g., Hispanic-oriented programming), and a theory by which the data could demonstrate causation or 
correlation between a policy and an outcome.  Absent this level of specificity, general calls to �conduct Adarand
studies� or to study the impact of the Commission�s rules on ownership diversity do not help advance the 
Commission�s research in these areas.

of a race- and/or gender-conscious measure, based on new information.  Additionally, the Commission 
will be on alert to any such data that may support such a finding and/or that may suggest steps that may 
lead to the collection of other relevant data.    
D. Additional Proposals Related to Minority and Female Ownership
317. As discussed in the FNPRM, several commenters asked the Commission to consider 
additional measures that they believed would foster ownership diversity.  Those measures include:  (1) 
relaxing the foreign ownership limitations under Section 310(b)(4) of the Communications Act; (2) 
encouraging Congress to reinstate and update tax certificate legislation; (3) granting waivers of the local 
radio ownership rule to parties that �incubate� qualified entities; and (4) migrating AM radio to VHF 
Channels 5 and 6.974 We also sought comment on various proposals that AWM asserted would help to 
promote ownership opportunities for women.975 We noted that some of these measures have already been 
implemented by the Commission and tentatively concluded that the other measures would raise public 
interest concerns, might not provide meaningful assistance to the intended beneficiaries, or are outside the 
scope of this proceeding.  
318. Since the release of the FNPRM, the Commission has implemented more of these 
measures, including several of the proposals regarding the AM band as discussed above.976 We also note 
that the 2008 Diversity Order considered a number of DCS�s earlier diversity proposals and adopted a 
dozen of those proposals, some with modifications.977 A number of commenters continue to support the 
Commission�s race-neutral efforts to promote ownership diversity.  For example, Bonneville/Scranton 
state that they agree with other commenters that the Commission should take concrete steps to address the 
problem of broadcast station financing for new entrants.978 Similarly, Morris recommends that the 
Commission seek targeted solutions that directly address disparities in ownership for women and 
minorities.979 By contrast, UCC et al., while supportive of efforts to promote ownership diversity, state 
that the race-neutral solutions that certain commenters support are unlikely to increase ownership 
opportunities for women and minorities and/or would raise public interest concerns.980 We discuss the 
specific proposals below.
1. Incubation 
319. In the FNPRM, we stated our concern that proposals like DCS�s incubation proposal, 
which would allow blanket waivers of the local radio ownership rule to broadcasters that finance or 
incubate an SDB or �valid eligible entity,� would allow for more consolidation in local radio markets than 
our rules currently permit without sufficient offsetting benefits.981 In addition, we stated that 
implementation of an incubator program would pose other concerns and administrative challenges, 
including challenges relating to the need to monitor over time the types of complex financing and other

arrangements that would qualify an entity for an incubation waiver under DCS�s incubation proposal.982  
320. In response to the FNPRM, NAA continues to support an incubator program for 
broadcasters to finance disadvantaged businesses.983 NAB also urges the Commission to remain open to 
proposals for a voluntary incubation program, despite the Commission�s concerns about DCS�s 
incubation proposal.  NAB recommends that the Commission use an incubator program as a means of 
reexamining and testing an ODP standard, as MMTC has proposed.984 AWM and Bonneville/Scranton 
also support this approach.985 UCC et al., however, share the Commission�s concern that an incubator 
program that uses a broad definition of qualifying entity would be difficult to administer and could create 
a substantial loophole in the Commission�s ownership rules without having any significant impact on 
minority and female ownership.986  
321. We do not believe that our concerns are addressed by the incubator program that NAB 
proposes, which would rely on an ODP standard to define the class of entities eligible to benefit from 
incubation.  As discussed above, we find that the type of individualized consideration that would be 
required under an ODP standard would be administratively inefficient, unduly resource-intensive, and 
potentially inconsistent with First Amendment values.987 Therefore, limiting the incubator program in the 
manner that NAB suggests would not address our concern that implementation of an incubator program 
would pose administrative challenges, such as the need to monitor continually the complicated legal and 
financial agreements between broadcasters and the entities they seek to incubate.  Other commenters that 
urge the Commission to adopt an incubator program similarly do not address the policy and practical 
concerns we identified above.  Therefore, we decline to adopt an incubator program as proposed by NAB 
and others.      
2. Migration of AM Radio to VHF Channels 5 and 6
322. In the FNPRM, we sought comment on our tentative conclusion not to adopt the proposal 
that most AM radio be migrated to VHF Channels 5 and 6 in this proceeding.  In response to the FNPRM,
commenters did not express opposition to this tentative conclusion.   No commenters dispute that 
implementation of this proposal would involve extensive changes to the Commission�s current licensing 
rules and spectrum policies.  As noted in the FNPRM, Congress directed the Commission to conduct an 
incentive auction of broadcast television spectrum�which is ongoing�in order to make additional 
spectrum available for wireless use.988 We find that implementation of the Channel 5 and 6 proposal has a 
realistic potential to interfere with the Commission�s implementation of the incentive auction and is 
therefore contrary to the spectrum policies established by Congress.  Accordingly, we decline to adopt 
this proposal.  
3. Additional DCS Proposals
323. The FNPRM identified numerous other DCS proposals that involved changes to various 
Commission licensing, service, and engineering rules and policies.989 It also noted that some of the

proposals related to the AM band were already being considered in a separate proceeding.990 MMTC 
continues to urge the adoption of these proposals, while NAA expresses support for the relaxation of the 
main studio rule (Proposal 16).991
324. As noted above, certain of these proposals regarding the AM band have already been 
addressed in another proceeding, so we need not address them herein.992 Moreover, we note that 
relaxation of the main studio rule�among other DCS proposals�is being explored in the AM 
Revitalization Proceeding.993 While there is some general support for the remaining proposals�primarily 
from MMTC�we do not believe that the record establishes that these changes to Commission licensing, 
service, and engineering rules and policies would provide meaningful benefits to the intended 
beneficiaries.  Commenters have had multiple opportunities to voice support for these proposals and 
explain the potential benefits that would arise from their implementation, but the record contains almost 
no support for the vast majority of these proposals.  
325. The Commission has reviewed these proposals multiple times throughout the course of 
this proceeding.  Those proposals that, based on our analysis, warranted additional consideration have 
been explored in relevant proceedings, such as the AM Revitalization Proceeding.  However, upon 
review, we determine that many of these proposals would be ineffective or insufficient to address the 
diversity issues under consideration in this proceeding.  Despite multiple opportunities for comment, the 
record reflects little support for the majority of these proposals or evidence that would cause us to 
reconsider our determination that these proposals warrant additional consideration or adoption.  
Accordingly, consistent with our tentative conclusion in the FNPRM, we decline to adopt these 
proposals.994
326. In the FNPRM, we also tentatively concluded that certain DCS proposals are outside the 
scope of this proceeding.995 We explained that some of those proposals extend into areas that are beyond

Nov. 10, 2014) (urging the Commission to consider the DCS proposals MMTC continues to support).
992 See supra para. 245.  We also note that DCS asks the Commission to clarify that the 18-month construction 
extension policy applies both to original construction permits (for the construction of new stations) and to 
construction permits for major modifications of authorized broadcast facilities (Proposal 17).  This is not a new 
diversity-related proposal, but a request for a clarification of an existing policy, which we have provided herein.  See 
supra para. 285 & note 864.  
993 AM Revitalization NOI, 30 FCC Rcd at 12179-81, paras. 85-88.  And while we decline to adopt a specific waiver 
standard for the main studio rule in this proceeding, we note that currently licensees are able to seek waiver of the 
rule under the Commission�s general wavier standard.  47 CFR � 1.3.
994 The proposals that we decline to adopt are as follows:  (1) Bifurcate Channels for Share-Times with SDBs; (2) 
Use the Share-Time Rule to Allow Broadcasters to Share Frequencies to Foster Ownership of DTV and FM 
Subchannels; (3) Extend the Three-Year Period for New Station Construction Permits for Eligible Entities and

the Commission�s authority and ultimately would require legislative action or action by other federal 
entities aside from the Commission in order to create changes in rules or policies.996 We further explained 
that other proposals involve non-broadcast services that are outside the scope of our quadrennial review 
proceedings.997 While we stated that we that we did not anticipate taking further action on these proposals 
within this or successive quadrennial review dockets, we also noted that some of these proposals may 
warrant further consideration.998  
327. MMTC challenges the Commission�s decision not to consider these 24 proposals in this 
proceeding.999 According to MMTC, these proposals were squarely within the scope of the 2010 
Quadrennial Review proceeding and �unquestionably� within the scope of the Diversity proceeding; thus, 
states MMTC, the Commission appears to have declined to consider these proposals for no valid 
reason.1000 MMTC also raised this issue in the appeal of the FNPRM.1001  In the course of the Prometheus 
III litigation, the court issued a letter to MMTC asking it to �address which, if any, of the 24 proposals . . . 
met both of the following criteria: 1) the FCC can adopt them without actions by Congress or other 
regulators and 2) they relate to the broadcast industry.�1002 In response, MMTC identified 17 proposals 
that it asserted met both criteria;1003 in a reply letter to the court, the Commission indicated that it would 
address the proposals in this item.1004 In Prometheus III, the court declined to act on MMTC�s challenge, 
but indicated that it expected the Commission to adhere to its representations to the court.1005
328. Following the release of Prometheus III, MMTC met with Commission staff to discuss 
the 17 proposals identified for the court.  Following these discussions, MMTC now requests that the 
Commission address five of these proposals in this Order; the remaining 12 proposals are being 
withdrawn from consideration in the context of this proceeding, though MMTC asserts that it may pursue 
some of these proposals in other proceedings.1006 In addition, MMTC is also withdrawing from

consideration in this proceeding the seven proposals that it did not identify to the Third Circuit, which 
largely were legislative recommendations.1007 Consistent with the direction from the Third Circuit and the 
revised request from MMTC, we will now address the five remaining proposals, as follows.1008
329. Proposal 5.  MMTC requests that the Commission consider how to promote minority 
ownership as part of all of its media-related proceedings.1009 At the outset, we note that OCBO �currently 
provides outreach services to assist small businesses and new entrants into the communications industry 
and input on how our proposed rules impact minority ownership.�1010 While OCBO already plays an 
important role in this process, we find there is potentially room to do more to help inform our 
(Continued from previous page)    
Parte Letter); NABOB July 11, 2016 Ex Parte Letter at 1 (supporting the five MMTC proposals).  The remaining 12 
proposals presented to the Third Circuit are:  (1) Collect, Study and Report on Minority and Women Participation in 
Each Step for the Broadcast Auction Process; (2) Increase Broadcast Auction Discounts to New Entrants; (3) 
Require Minimum Opening Bid Deposits on Each Allotment for Bidders Bidding for an Excessive Proportion of 
Available Allotments; (4) Only Allow Subsequent Bids to Be Made Within No More than Six Rounds Following the 
Initial Bid; and (5) Require Bidders to Specify an Intention to Bid Only on Channels with a Total Minimum Bid of 
Four Times Their Deposits; (6) Grant Eligible Entities a Rebuttable Presumption of Eligibility for Waivers, 
Reductions, or Deferrals of Commission Fees; (7) Designate a Commissioner to Oversee Access to Capital and 
Funding Acquisition Recommendations; (8) Develop an Online Resource Directory to Enhance Recruitment, Career 
Advancement, and Diversity Efforts; (9) Study the Feasibility of a New Radio Agreement with Cuba; (10) Must-
Carry for Certain Class A Stations; (11) Create a Media and Telecom Public Engineer Position to Assist Small 
Businesses and Nonprofits with Routine Engineering Matters; and (12) Conduct Tutorials on Radio Engineering 
Rules at Headquarters and Annual Conferences.  Id. at 9-10; see also NAA June 30, 2016 Ex Parte Letter, Attach. at 
1-2 (supporting MMTC�s proposals to conduct radio engineering tutorials at FCC headquarters and annual 
conferences and to develop an online resource directory to enhance recruitment, career advancement, and diversity 
efforts).   
1007 These legislative recommendations include:  (1) Legislative Recommendation to Expand the 
Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF) Under Section 614 and Finance TDF with Auction Proceeds; (2) 
Legislative Recommendation to Amend Section 257 to Require the Commission to Annually Review and Remove 
or Affirmatively Prohibit Known Market Entry Barriers; (3) Legislative Recommendation to Clarify Section 307(b) 
to Provide that Rules Adopted to Promote Localism are Presumed to be Invalid if They Significantly Inhibit 
Diversity; (4) Legislative Recommendation to Amend the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. �� 41-58) to Prohibit Racial 
Discrimination in Advertising Placement Terms and Advertising Sales Agreements; (5) Legislative 
Recommendation to Amend Section 614 to Increase Access to Capital by Creating a Small and Minority 
Communications Loan Guarantee Program; (6) Legislative Recommendation to Amend Section 614 to Create an
Entity to Purchase Loans Made to Minority and Small Businesses in the Secondary Market; (7) Legislative 
Recommendation to Provide Tax Credit for Companies that Donate Broadcast Stations to an Institution Whose 
Mission is or Includes Training Minorities and Women in Broadcasting.  Id. at 10-11; see MMTC FNPRM

Parte Letter, Attach. at 2 (supporting the legislative recommendations to create a small and minority 
communications loan guarantee program and to provide tax credits to companies that donate broadcast stations to 
institutions that train minorities and women in broadcasting).
1008 While these proposals were originally submitted in this proceeding as part of the DCS Supplemental NPRM 
Comments, we note that MMTC submitted the comments on behalf of DCS; accordingly, we find that it is 
appropriate to rely on MMTC�s assertions regarding the preferred treatment of these proposals in this proceeding.  
Moreover, consistent with the Third Circuit�s letter, we are generally limiting our consideration of these proposals to 
the extent that they relate to the broadcast industry.  See supra para. 327.

consideration of these important issues.  Accordingly, going forward, the Commission will consider how 
to promote minority ownership in relevant media-related rulemaking proceedings and include an inquiry 
in any appropriate rulemaking to inform that question.
330. Proposal 10. MMTC also proposes that the Commission extend the cable procurement 
requirements to broadcasters and other regulated communications industries.1011 We note that the 
Commission�s OCBO has already implemented various initiatives consistent with this proposal, holding 
multiple supplier diversity conferences and a government advertising workshop�and we anticipate that 
there will be more such events in the future.1012 However, we find that there is merit in exploring 
whether, and if so, how, to extend the cable procurement requirements to the broadcasting industry.  
Therefore, we will evaluate the feasibility of adopting similar procurement rules for the broadcasting 
industry.
331. Proposal 33.  MMTC proposes two formulas it asserts are aimed at creating media 
ownership limits that promote diversity.  Specifically, it suggests a �Tipping Point Formula� that would 
be applied in the local radio rule context, and a �Source Diversity Formula� that appears to be more 
broadly applicable.1013 At present, neither of these proposals is sufficiently defined.  As MMTC itself 
notes, the Tipping Point Formula rests on �admittedly rough assumptions,� and the record does not 
provide us with sufficient information to justify or refine the formula for general application across all 
radio markets.1014 Similarly, the Source Diversity Formula �would require field-testing before it could be 
applied,� and we do not believe that the record provides us with the information necessary to rely on the 
formula to adopt media ownership limits.  We therefore direct the Media Bureau to consider these 
proposals further and to solicit input on these ideas in the document initiating the next quadrennial review 
of the media ownership rules.
332. Proposal 37.  MMTC also proposes that the Commission engage economists to �develop 
a model for market-based tradable diversity credits� that would serve as an alternative method for 
adopting ownership limits.1015 Broadly speaking, this proposal involves issuing �Diversity Credits� that

Commission adopted what DCS and MMTC refer to as the �cable procurement rule,� which generally requires that a 
cable system �encourage minority and female entrepreneurs to conduct business with all parts of its operation,� for 
example, by �[r]ecruiting as wide as possible a pool of qualified entrepreneurs from sources such as employee 
referrals, community groups, contractors, associations, and other sources likely to be representative of minority and 
female interests.�  47 CFR � 76.75(e); see 47 U.S.C. � 554(d)(2).

would be applied in the local radio rule context to determine the tipping point in the distribution of radio revenue in 
a market between independent owners and owners of multiple stations in that market.  The theory is that the 
independent stations would no longer be able to survive once the combined revenues of the owners of multiple 
stations exceed the tipping point.  DCS Supplemental NPRM Comments at 69-70.  The Source Diversity Formula is 
based on the premise that increases in consumer utility flow from their access to additional sources, with 
diminishing returns to scale, and is intended to express �the consumer benefit derived from marginal increases in 
source diversity.�  Id.

could be traded in a market-based system and redeemed by a station buyer to offset increased 
concentration that would result from a proposed transaction.1016 While the Commission�s authority to 
adopt such a system is, at best, unclear, we think there is merit in evaluating the underlying proposal.  We 
therefore direct the Media Bureau to consider this proposal further and to solicit input on this idea in the 
document initiating the next quadrennial review of the media ownership rules.
333. Proposal 40.  MMTC recommends the creation of a new Civil Rights Branch of the 
Enforcement Bureau that would enforce Media Bureau Equal Employment Opportunity rules, as well as 
other rules impacting the broadcasting, cable, satellite, wireless, and wireline industries.1017 We have 
evaluated this proposal, and we find it warrants further consideration.  Though we do not see a need to 
denominate a separate branch, enforcement of the Media Bureau Equal Employment Opportunity rules, 
which is presently handled by the Media Bureau, might be more appropriate as a function of the 
Enforcement Bureau, given the Enforcement Bureau�s existing mission and expertise in the enforcement 
of the Commission�s regulations.  We in no way, however, believe that the Media Bureau has failed to 
effectively enforce these rules.  Accordingly, we direct the appropriate Commission Bureaus and Offices, 
including the Media Bureau, Enforcement Bureau, and Office of the Managing Director, to discuss the 
feasibility, implications, and logistics of shifting the enforcement of the Media Bureau Equal 
Employment Opportunity rules from the Media Bureau to the Enforcement Bureau.
4. AWM Proposals
334. In response to the NPRM, AWM proposed that the Commission (i) prepare a primer on 
investment in broadcast ownership for smaller and regional lenders willing to provide loans to new 
broadcast entrants; (ii) prepare a primer for new entrants that provides guidance on how to find financing; 
(iii) establish a link on the Commission�s website to provide information on stations that may be available 
for sale to small businesses; and (iv) allow sellers to hold a reversionary interest in a Commission license 
in certain circumstances.1018 We sought comment on these proposals in the FNPRM.1019  NAB, in its 
FNPRM comments, states that it has previously urged the Commission to sponsor primers on investment 
and financing of broadcast properties and allow sellers to hold reversionary interests in broadcast licenses 
in certain circumstances.1020  
335. We believe we have acted to achieve the purposes of these proposals to the extent 
appropriate for the industry and the regulatory agency.  As we noted in the FNPRM, OCBO currently 
engages in a number of activities that provide broadcasters and potential investors with resources that are 
similar in substance to primers on investment and financing.1021 We discuss these activities above.1022  
Beyond those activities, we continue to believe that specific advice about investment and financing is 
more appropriately provided by private parties that are directly involved in the financial marketplace than 
by the Commission.  In particular, no additional commenters have urged us to adopt AWM�s proposal

that the Commission create a public listing of stations that may be available for sale to small businesses, 
and, as we explained in the FNPRM, the Commission currently does not have at its disposal the 
information that would be necessary to create such a resource.1023
336. With regard to the proposal to allow sellers to hold reversionary interests in Commission 
licenses in certain circumstances, we previously noted that AWM�s proposal does not address the 
Commission�s historical concerns about reversionary interests and is insufficiently developed to warrant 
departure from the Commission�s longstanding policy against the holding of such interests.  The 
Commission has traditionally held that no right of reversion can attach to a broadcast license and that a 
station licensee is fully responsible for the conduct of the station and its operation in the public interest�
a responsibility that cannot be delegated by contract.1024 While NAB notes that it has previously urged the 
Commission to allow sellers to hold reversionary interests in certain circumstances, NAB does not 
address the specific concerns we discussed in the FNPRM regarding this proposal.1025 Other commenters 
have not contributed to building a record on our reversionary interest policy in this proceeding.1026  
Accordingly, we decline to adopt these proposals.1027
V. SHARED SERVICE AGREEMENTS
A. Introduction
337. Today we bring transparency to the use of sharing agreements between independently 
owned commercial television stations.  Through these agreements, competitive stations in a local market 
are able to combine certain operations, with effectively the same station personnel handling or facilities 
performing functions for multiple, independently owned stations.  While such combined operations no 
doubt result in cost savings�savings that could be reinvested in improved programming and other public 
interest-promoting endeavors�we have an obligation to ensure that these agreements are not being used 
to circumvent the Commission�s broadcast ownership rules and are not otherwise inconsistent with the 
Commission�s rules and policies.  Today�s decision is an important step in that process.  
338. Specifically, in this Order and as discussed in greater detail below, we adopt a 
comprehensive definition of SSAs and a requirement that commercial television stations disclose these 
agreements by placing them in the stations� online public inspection files.  This method of disclosure will 
place a minimal burden on stations, while providing the public and the Commission with easy access to 
the agreements.  Accordingly, we find that the benefits of this rule outweigh the minimal burdens 
associated with disclosure.     
B. Background
339. The potential disclosure of SSAs has been considered in multiple Commission 
proceedings.  In the Enhanced Disclosure FNPRM, the Commission sought comment on whether the 
disclosure of sharing agreements that were not already defined and required to be disclosed under the 
Commission�s rules (e.g., local marketing agreements (LMAs) and JSAs)1028 would serve the public 
  
1023 FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4518, para. 319.
1024 See, e.g., Applications of Kidd Communications, 19 FCC Rcd 13584 (2004); see also 47 CFR � 73.1150 (�In 
transferring a broadcast station, the licensee may retain no right of reversion of the license. . . .�).

1026 See AWM FNPRM Reply at 1-2; Morris FNPRM Comments at 44-45 & n.150.
1027 If presented with appropriate evidence or analysis regarding the Commission�s historical concerns, the 
Commission may consider in a future proceeding a general review of its reversionary interest policy, subject to 
resource constraints.
1028 The Commission�s rules define local marketing agreements, also known as �time brokerage agreements,� as 
agreements where a licensee sells discrete blocks of time to a �broker� that supplies the programming to fill that 
time and sells the commercial spot announcements in it.  47 CFR � 73.3555, Note 1(j).  JSAs (joint sales

interest and whether to require stations to include such agreements in their public files.1029 Ultimately, the 
Commission declined to adopt any new disclosure requirements for sharing agreements in that proceeding 
but indicated that it would continue to monitor the issue and revisit the disclosure requirement in the 
future.1030 Concurrent with the pendency of the Enhanced Disclosure proceeding, the Commission sought 
comment in the NPRM in the 2010 Quadrennial Review proceeding about various types of sharing 
agreements, noting that commenters to the NOI in that proceeding had specifically identified sharing 
agreements involving commercial television stations and a subcategory of such agreements, local news 
sharing (LNS) agreements, as matters of concern, but acknowledging that these terms were not defined in 
Commission rules.1031 The NPRM invited views on the potential impact of such agreements on the 
Commission�s ownership rules and fundamental policy goals, invited submissions of further information 
about how to define such agreements, and sought comment on whether they should be attributed or 
disclosed.1032
340. Building on the comments filed in response to the NPRM, the FNPRM focused the 
inquiry onto whether and how to require the disclosure of certain SSAs.  Specifically, the FNPRM
proposed a comprehensive definition of SSAs designed to encompass the universe of agreements that 
parties broadly referred to as �sharing agreements.�  The FNPRM also sought comment on whether the 
proposed definition was too expansive and on ways in which the definition could be limited without 
negatively impacting the public�s and the Commission�s interest in understanding the breadth and 
prevalence of these agreements.1033 In addition, the FNPRM asked whether disclosure of SSAs by 
commercial television stations was necessary to enable the public and the Commission to evaluate the 
impact of these agreements, and if so, what method of disclosure would best serve the public interest 
(e.g., placing SSAs in each station�s online public file, or creating a new form to be filed with the 
Commission).1034 The item also sought comment on related issues, such as whether to apply the 
disclosure requirement to other services (e.g., commercial radio stations, noncommercial television and 
radio stations) and whether to permit the redaction of confidential or proprietary information, as is 
permitted with respect to the filing of LMAs and JSAs.1035
C. Discussion
341. We find that commenters have raised meaningful concerns regarding the potential impact 
of sharing agreements involving commercial television stations on our competition, localism, and 
diversity policy objectives, particularly with respect to our local broadcast ownership rules.  At the same 
time, resource sharing can deliver meaningful public interest benefits, and the sharing of certain resources 
may have no negative impact on any of our policy goals.  At present, however, consideration of these 
issues is impeded because so little is known by the Commission and the public about the content, scope, 
(Continued from previous page)    
agreements) are defined as agreements with a licensee of a �brokered station� that authorizes a �broker� to sell 
advertising time for the �brokered station.�  47 CFR � 73.3555, Note 1(k).

and prevalence of sharing agreements.1036 In order to assess these issues, we first adopt a clear definition 
of SSAs�substantially similar to the definition proposed in the FNPRM�in order to identify the 
agreements between stations that are relevant to our improved understanding of how stations share 
services and resources.  Next, we adopt a mechanism for making such arrangements involving 
commercial television stations transparent to the public and the Commission.1037 Specifically, commercial 
television stations will now be required to disclose these agreements by placing them in the participating 
stations� online public inspection files.  Through our actions today, the public and the Commission will be 
able to better evaluate the impact of these agreements, if any, on our policy goals.  
1. Definition of Shared Service Agreement
342. Scope of definition.  In the FNPRM, we proposed to define an SSA as any agreement or 
series of agreements, whether written or oral, in which (1) a station, or any individual or entity with an 
attributable interest in the station, provides any station-related services, including, but not limited to, 
administrative, technical, sales, and/or programming support, to a station that is not under common 
ownership (as defined by the Commission�s attribution rules); or (2) stations that are not under common 
ownership (as defined by the Commission�s attribution rules), or any individuals or entities with an 
attributable interest in those stations, collaborate to provide or enable the provision of station-related 
services, including, but not limited to, administrative, technical, sales, and/or programming support, to 
one or more of the collaborating stations.1038
343. Many commenters express support for the definition proposed in the FNPRM, asserting 
that it is important to adopt a definition broad enough to ensure that all types of sharing agreements are 
identified (and ultimately disclosed).1039 In addition, Free Press asserts that a narrower definition would 
invite legal gamesmanship, whereby agreements would be drafted in such a way as to avoid disclosure.1040
344. Broadcast commenters, however, assert that the definition is overbroad.1041 The Smaller 
Market Coalition, for example, asserts that the proposed definition of SSA greatly expands on the type of 
agreements commonly known as sharing agreements and would apply to even minor collaborations 
between stations, including community service initiatives and breaking news coverage.1042 Similarly, 
NAB argues that the definition is overbroad because it covers agreements that are not tied to a station�s 
core operations and are not �reasonably related to any regulatory concern.�1043 For example, NAB states 
that sharing agreements covering administrative support or other back-office services do not raise 
attribution or transfer of control concerns; therefore, they should not be included in the definition of SSAs 
for disclosure purposes.1044 NAB also objects to the definition because it encompasses other types of 
agreements that are already defined by the Commission and subject to various regulations.1045 Although 
the FNPRM requested possible alternatives to the proposed definition, no commenter submitted an 
  
1036 This is not the case, however, with respect to LMAs and JSAs, which are well-known and understood subsets of 
sharing agreements that are already attributable in certain circumstances.  47 CFR � 73.3555, Note 2(k).
1037 As discussed below, we decline to extend the SSA disclosure requirement to include agreements involving radio 
stations and/or noncommercial television stations.

alternate definition for consideration.1046  
345. We find that the definition proposed in the FNPRM, with a minor modification discussed 
below, best comports with the informational needs that support our efforts to define SSAs.  Contrary to 
broadcaster assertions, we do not believe it is appropriate to exclude certain resource sharing, such as 
administrative support or other back-office services, from the definition based on premature assessments 
of the potential future regulatory treatment of such activities.  In addition, we agree with Free Press that a 
definition narrower than the one we adopt today would invite legal gamesmanship whereby parties would 
be able to draft sharing agreements to fall outside of the established definition to avoid disclosure.1047 For 
this reason, we will not adopt exclusions from the definition of SSA, such as those based on the duration 
of the agreement or a set dollar amount.  Otherwise, an entity wishing to circumvent the disclosure 
requirement could merely break down an SSA into a series of shorter or smaller agreements that would 
each fall below the established parameters.  Similarly, as noted in the FNPRM, a financial exclusion 
would omit otherwise significant sharing agreements that involve in-kind contributions.  We do not 
believe that excluding these types of agreements from the definition of SSA would further our objectives 
or serve the public interest. 
346. In order to address concerns expressed by certain commenters, however,1048 we 
emphasize that the definition we adopt limits the scope of agreements to those that involve station-related 
services.  We also provide non-exhaustive examples in the definition for guidance, consistent with the 
proposal in the FNPRM.1049 Indeed, it is not our goal to adopt a definition of SSAs that encompasses 
station interactions that do not relate to station operations or that are incidental in nature.  For example, 
community service initiatives and charity events, while worthwhile in their own regard, do not relate to 
the operation of the broadcast station; accordingly, charitable collaborations involving independently 
owned broadcast stations would not fit within the definition of SSAs that we adopt here.    
347. Similarly, we clarify that ad hoc or �on-the-fly� arrangements during breaking news 
coverage are also outside the definition of SSAs.  While such interactions may involve a station-related 
service, namely news-gathering, such informal, short-term arrangements are typically precipitated by 
unforeseen or rapidly developing events.  Absent a covering agreement that facilitates such cooperation, 
we do not believe that these types of interactions demonstrate that the stations are working together; 
rather, they are acting in a manner that allows each station to separately pursue its own ends (e.g., the 
production of an independent news story).1050 By contrast, such conduct would be evidence of 
collaboration, and included in the definition of SSAs, if the stations were parties to an LNS agreement (or 
similar agreement) that governs the terms of news coverage, even if the stations retain the ability to 
produce their own segments. 
348. Text of Definition. While we find that a clear definition of SSAs is appropriate, one 
technical change to the text proposed in the FNPRM is necessary.  In the FNPRM, the proposed definition 
of SSAs was designed to identify the universe of agreements for the provision of station-related services

1050 For example, if two news trucks from independently owned broadcast television stations arrive at the scene of an 
accident at the same time and agree to set up their camera shots from different angles or to rely on the footage shot 
by only one of the stations due to limited space and safety concerns, this agreement does not evidence actual 
collaboration between the stations to produce the news segments.  Instead, the news teams are reacting to unforeseen 
circumstances and ensuring that each news team can safely and effectively create its own news story.  
Federal Communications Commission FCC 16-107
149
involving stations that are not under common control.1051 Stations under common control do not �share� 
services or collaborate in the same way as stations that operate independently for purposes of this 
definition.  After review, we believe that the proposed language failed to appropriately reflect our intent 
regarding the scope of the requirement, which covers agreements between stations �not under common 
ownership.�  Specifically, the phrase �not under common ownership (as defined by the Commission�s 
attribution rules),� in the absence of context, could be read to exclude from the definition those stations 
that simply share a single attributable interest holder, which was not our intent for purposes of this rule.  
To rectify this, we will replace this phrase with one used by Congress in the STELA Reauthorization Act 
of 2014, in which Congress banned all joint retransmission negotiations by stations in the same market 
that are not under common de jure control.1052 In the statute, Congress defined stations as commonly 
owned when they were �directly or indirectly under common de jure control permitted under the 
Commission�s regulations.�  Adopting this revised language will define SSAs as agreements between 
stations that are not under common de jure control, which was our purpose in the FNPRM.
349. Accordingly, we define an SSA as any agreement or series of agreements, whether 
written or oral, in which (1) a station provides any station-related services, including, but not limited to, 
administrative, technical, sales, and/or programming support, to a station that is not directly or indirectly 
under common de jure control permitted under the Commission�s regulations; or (2) stations that are not 
directly or indirectly under common de jure control permitted under the Commission�s regulations 
collaborate to provide or enable the provision of station-related services, including, but not limited to, 
administrative, technical, sales, and/or programming support, to one or more of the collaborating stations. 
For purposes of this rule, the term �station� includes the licensee, including any subsidiaries and affiliates, 
and any other individual or entity with an attributable interest in the station.1053 Consistent with previous 
Commission rules, the substance of oral agreements shall be reduced to writing.1054  
2. Disclosure of Shared Service Agreements
350. Justification for disclosure.  Many commenters support the Commission�s proposed 
disclosure requirement.1055 According to these commenters, broad disclosure of SSAs is necessary to 
provide the public and the Commission with the information necessary to evaluate the potential impact of 
these agreements on the Commission�s rules and policies, as well as in license renewal proceedings.1056  
In addition, Free Press asserts that the disclosure requirement should apply both to the brokered station 
  
1051 See, e.g., FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd at 4523, para. 331.
1052 Pub. L. No. 113-200, 128 Stat. 2059 (2014); see 47 U.S.C. � 325(b)(3)(C) (as amended by Section 103 of the 
STELAR).
1053 We emphasize that sharing agreements to which non-licensee entities are a party (e.g., an operating subsidiary of 
the ultimate parent company) fall within the definition we adopt herein.  We find that including such entities within 
the term �station� is necessary to foreclose the possibility that stations could use operating subsidiaries or similar 
entities to evade the SSA disclosure requirement.  This is consistent with our proposal in the FNPRM that we should 
not limit the definition of SSAs to only those agreements to which licensees are parties.  See FNPRM, 29 FCC Rcd
at 4523, para. 332 (stating that limiting the definition of SSAs to agreements between licensees would exclude 
existing agreements intended for inclusion and afford a means to evade disclosure requirements).

and the brokering station.1057  
351. Multiple broadcast commenters oppose the disclosure requirement based on concerns that 
the disclosure requirement is unduly burdensome.1058 These commenters argue that the requirement 
will�and is, in fact, designed to�discourage stations from entering into SSAs, which will lead to a 
reduction in investment in local programming and station improvements.1059 NAB also raises First 
Amendment concerns by asserting that the disclosure requirement represents an intrusion into the day-to-
day operations of broadcast station�the newsroom, in particular.1060  
352. While NAB states that it does not oppose disclosure of sharing agreements if the 
transparency would promote the Commission�s policy goals, NAB argues that the proposed broad 
disclosure requirement fails to do so.1061 While NAB concedes that the Commission �can properly solicit 
information from private parties in order [to] better fulfill its statutory mandate,� NAB contends that the 
Commission has failed to tie the �broad-ranging� disclosure requirement to any identified regulatory 
issue, statutory mandate, or proposed regulation.1062 According to NAB, the Commission must first 
identify a specific problem or regulatory action before requiring disclosure of SSAs.1063  
353. Free Press and UCC et al. reject the claims that the proposed disclosure requirement is 
too broad and not sufficiently connected to specific regulatory concerns.  They argue that commenters 
have identified potential concerns associated with these agreements, and the Commission has determined 
that it lacks information on the breadth and substance of SSAs, which hinders its ability to evaluate the 
commenters� concerns.1064 According to UCC et al., NAB is wrong to suggest that the Commission must 
identify regulatory violations before requiring disclosure, as disclosure is first necessary to allow the 
public and the Commission to review and analyze the agreements.1065 Similarly, Free Press disputes 
NAB�s assertion that certain SSAs, such as those involving back-office or administrative services, should

covered by existing regulations, so disclosure is not necessary.  Id. at 99-100.  For example, NAB states that LMAs 
and JSAs�types of sharing agreements�are already regulated, station staffing issues are addressed by the main

not be disclosed because they do not pose any attribution or other regulatory concerns.  According to Free 
Press, this is precisely the question at issue and such determinations cannot be made until the agreements 
have been disclosed and analyzed.1066 According to UCC et al., these agreements are not available from 
any other source, so the disclosure requirement is necessary to facilitate this analysis.1067  These 
commenters also reject contentions that the disclosure requirement is overbroad because certain subsets of 
SSAs, such as LMAs and JSAs, are already defined and regulated by the Commission and the disclosure 
requirement would have no impact on these agreements (i.e., an agreement need only be disclosed 
once).1068
354. We require the disclosure of SSAs in each participating station�s online public inspection 
file, as explained in greater detail below.  The SSA disclosure requirement shall apply regardless of 
whether the agreement involves stations in the same market or in different markets.  This approach 
follows the approach taken with the public file disclosures for JSAs and LMAs and is consistent with our 
intent to learn more about how commercial television stations use these agreements. 1069 We find that this 
disclosure requirement is tied to a clear regulatory purpose.  Commenters in the proceeding have raised 
meaningful issues regarding the potential impact of the joint operation of independently owned 
commercial broadcast television stations pursuant to SSAs on the Commission�s rules and policy goals, 
including, but not limited to, the Commission�s local broadcast ownership rules and rules regarding
unauthorized transfer of control.1070 These commenters have identified specific provisions in sharing 
agreements that, according to the commenters, convey a significant degree of influence over the core 
operating functions of an independent commercial television station (and potentially de facto control over 
the station).1071 In addition, commenters have also provided examples of markets in which sharing 
agreements have been executed and of the asserted impact of these agreements on the market (e.g., job 
losses and reductions in independently produced local news programming).1072 According to these 
commenters, such sharing agreements impact the Commission�s competition, localism, and diversity 
goals, as well as suggest violations of the Commission�s rules against unauthorized transfers of control.  
The disclosure of these agreements is necessary for the public and the Commission to evaluate these 
potential impacts.  
355. Moreover, the Commission�s rules have long required that television and radio broadcast 
stations enable public inspection of certain documents to provide information both to the public and to the 
Commission about station operations.1073 The public and the Commission rely on information about the 
nature of a station�s operations and compliance with Commission rules to verify that a station is meeting 
its fundamental public interest obligations. The Commission has consistently found that disclosure 
requirements facilitate the Commission�s regulatory purposes while imposing only a minimal burden on 
licensees.1074

356. Additionally, we disagree that the Commission must first address the appropriate 
regulatory status of sharing agreements (e.g., make them attributable) prior to requiring their disclosure. 
For example, we agree with Free Press and UCC et al. in rejecting NAB�s assertion that back-office or 
administrative agreements�agreements that clearly relate to station operations within the definition of 
SSAs we adopt herein�should be excluded from disclosure because they currently do not raise any 
attribution or other regulatory concerns.  Disclosure itself informs such decisions, and the Commission 
has wide latitude to impose such a requirement.1075 Moreover, such agreements may also help inform 
allegations involving unauthorized transfers of control.  In the past, the Commission has first required the 
disclosure of certain agreements that relate to station operations prior to making a determination that such 
agreements should be subject to additional regulation.1076 Our action today is consistent with this 
precedent.  Indeed, the Commission could hardly fulfill its obligation to ensure that station operations are 
consistent with Commission rules and policies if it were required to determine the regulatory status of 
certain agreements before obtaining the information necessary to evaluate the agreements.  We do not 
think the public interest would be served by adopting such a constricted view of the Commission�s 
authority.      
357. Furthermore, we are not persuaded that the disclosure requirement adopted today will 
discourage stations from entering into SSAs.  First, the adopted method for disclosure minimizes the cost 
of compliance and utilizes a procedure with which commercial television broadcasters already have 
extensive experience.1077 It cannot be credibly stated that the burden associated with disclosure would 
exceed the benefits of the agreements.  Second, we find it instructive that there is no evidence that the

the Commission to make such a determination.

disclosure requirements for JSAs and LMAs, specific types of SSAs, have inhibited the formation of 
those agreements.  To the contrary, the Commission first required the public filing of television JSAs in 
1999, and the prevalence of these agreements increased significantly after the disclosure requirement was 
adopted.1078 Ultimately, we do not find any evidence to support the contention that disclosure of SSAs 
would discourage stations from executing such agreements, particularly if the agreements are as 
beneficial as broadcast commenters contend.   
358. Finally, we reject NAB�s assertion that the SSA disclosure requirement would violate the 
First Amendment because the Commission is �immersing itself in broadcasting stations� day-to-day 
operations.�1079 The cases cited by NAB in support of its theory are readily distinguishable from the 
disclosure requirement adopted today, as neither case involves simply requiring disclosure of contracts 
relating to station operations.1080 Contrary to NAB�s claims, the Commission is not interfering with 
broadcasters� editorial discretion.1081 Rather, the Commission is simply requiring that commercial 
television stations place certain contracts in their public file, just as the Commission has done numerous 
times in the past.1082 In particular, we are not restricting broadcasters� discretion to determine what 
content to offer, nor are we mandating or prohibiting any particular contractual terms.  Thus, the 
disclosure requirement does not burden broadcasters� speech.1083 Further, there is no evidence that 
previous disclosure requirements have resulted in such involvement.  For example, television LMAs or 
JSAs that include local news programming and/or production have long been subject to disclosure, but 
there is no evidence that the Commission has subsequently become immersed in the day-to-day 
production of local news or that disclosure of the agreements has otherwise impacted station operations.  
Indeed, the Commission has a long history of deferring to a �licensee�s good faith discretion� in 
programming decisions�particularly news programming�and we believe that the SSA disclosure 
requirement is consistent with this precedent.1084 In this case, we are not even proposing to regulate SSAs 
beyond the bare disclosure requirement.
359. NAB further argues that the disclosure requirement fails to satisfy the constitutional 
standards for regulations that require businesses to disclose factual information, stating that the agency

1083 In particular, we are not compelling broadcasters to express a message or viewpoint.  See United States v. Sindel, 
53 F.3d 874, 878 (8th Cir. 1995) (finding that IRS summons did not require plaintiff to �disseminate publicly a

must show that there is a �substantial government interest� that is �directly and materially advanced by 
the restriction� and that the restriction is narrowly tailored to achieve the government interest.1085 On the 
contrary, even assuming that the disclosure requirement burdens broadcasters� speech to any extent 
(which we conclude above is not the case), the requirement would be subject, at most, to rational basis 
review, which is the same standard that courts have applied to the Commission�s ownership rules.1086  
Under this standard of review, a rule does not violate the First Amendment if it is �a reasonable means of 
promoting the public interest in diversified mass communications.�1087
360. Our SSA disclosure requirement satisfies this standard.  SSAs relate to a broadcast 
station�s core operational functions and thus could have the effect of lessening competition, diversity, or 
localism by creating a commonality of interests.  They could also have beneficial effects.  Public interest 
commenters and broadcasters have conflicting viewpoints about whether SSAs should be deemed 
attributable for purposes of our ownership rules and whether they negatively or positively affect our 
public interest goals of competition, diversity, and localism.  Without an industry-wide disclosure rule, 
we lack the information necessary to determine the extent to which SSAs may affect diversity, 
competition, and localism and whether SSAs in fact confer significant influence or control warranting 
attribution for purposes of our ownership rules or raising unauthorized control concerns.  Although 
broadcasters have disclosed SSAs in connection with individual license assignments/transfers of control 
applications, we do not know what types of SSA are in place between stations that are not parties to such 
pending Commission applications, nor do we know the extent to which broadcasters across the industry 
utilize SSAs that are not already required to be disclosed.  Thus, we believe industry-wide disclosure is 
necessary to allow the Commission and public to evaluate in a comprehensive manner the extent to which 
broadcasters use various types of SSA, the nature of the contractual relationships, and the manner in 
which specific types of agreements affect competition, diversity, or localism.1088 Broadcasters hold 
licenses issued by the Commission and are obligated to operate in the public interest, and thus they have 
no right to withhold from the Commission or the public agreements that may significantly affect their 
service to the public.  Therefore, our rule is a reasonable means of promoting the Commission�s diversity, 
competition, and localism goals and assuring that SSAs do not raise unauthorized control concerns and 
satisfies the criteria for First Amendment rational basis review.
361. The case law NAB cites in support of a higher standard of review concerns requiring a 
regulated entity to undertake new speech,1089 and presents the question of whether a restriction on 
commercial speech, normally subject to intermediate scrutiny, satisfies the criteria for rational basis 
review under the exception applicable to compelled commercial speech that is strictly factual.1090 Here, in

contrast, the Commission is simply requiring broadcasters to publicly disclose contracts they have already 
executed, not undertake new speech.  Further, although the SSA disclosure rule does nothing more than 
require placement of SSAs in the broadcasters� public inspection file, it is subject to rational basis review 
for a different reason (i.e., because it is a content-neutral rule that furthers our scheme of broadcast 
ownership regulation and the policy goals supporting such regulation).1091 Thus, if the SSA disclosure 
requirement burdens speech at all, the rational basis review applicable to structural broadcast 
regulations�not the intermediate scrutiny standard applicable to commercial speech�applies to the 
disclosure requirement.
362.  Finally, even assuming that the intermediate scrutiny standard of Central Hudson
applies, which we conclude is not the case, the rule �directly and materially� advances governmental 
interests that the Supreme Court has recognized as substantial.1092 The purpose of the rule is to provide 
information that is directly relevant to our regulation of broadcast ownership and the policy goals that 
underlie our ownership rules.  The filing of SSAs will further our goal of collecting the necessary 
information.  We have tailored the requirement to exclude agreements that are already subject to 
disclosure in a station�s public file and to exclude agreements that are not likely to implicate our policy 
concerns.  The rule does not restrict or dictate the ways in which broadcasters may share resources but 
simply requires them to disclose contracts that already exist.  The filing requirement is therefore narrowly 
tailored to achieve the regulatory objective, and the burden is minimal.  Accordingly, we find that the 
disclosure requirement does not violate the First Amendment even under the higher standard of review 
that NAB advocates.
363. Disclosure in station�s online public inspection file.  We will require commercial 
broadcast television stations to post SSAs to each participating station�s online public inspection file that 
is hosted by the Commission.  Multiple commenters support SSA disclosure in a station�s public 
inspection file (online, physical, or both).1093 According to Free Press, the nominal cost of scanning and 
uploading an SSA into a station�s online public inspection file would be exceeded by the benefits of 
disclosure.1094 UCC et al. oppose limiting disclosure of SSAs to just the physical public inspection file or 
by filing directly with the Commission, as these methods would make it difficult for members of the 
public to access the agreements; rather, UCC et al. argue that disclosure in the stations� online public 
inspection files is the right approach.1095 In addition, they support the creation of a permanent docket in 
  
1091 See Sinclair, 284 F.3d at 168.
1092 See Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 663 (1994) (�Likewise, assuring that the public has access to 
a multiplicity of information sources is a governmental purpose of the highest order, for it promotes values central to 
the First Amendment.�); id. at 664 (�[T]he Government�s interest in eliminating restraints on fair competition is 
always substantial, even when the individuals or entities subject to particular regulations are engaged in expressive 
activity protected by the First Amendment.�) (citations omitted); Time Warner Cable Inc. v. FCC, 729 F.3d 137, 160 
(2d Cir. 2013).
1093 See Free Press FNRPM Comments at 25 (supporting disclosure in both the online and physical public inspection 
file); SAG-AFTRA FNPRM Comments at 3 (supporting disclosure in a station�s public inspection file); UCC et al. 
FNRPM Comments at 7 (advocating for disclosure in a station�s online public file); WGAW FNPRM Comments at 
14.  Free Press asserts that television LMAs and JSAs must be placed both in a station�s online and physical public 
inspection files, so it would be consistent to require the same for SSAs.  See Free Press FNPRM Comments at 25.  
This, however, is not consistent with the public file rule, which requires only that television LMAs and JSAs be 
placed in the online public file.

1095 UCC et al. FNPRM Comments at 8.  We note that the Commission recently proposed to eliminate the

ECFS for all new SSAs and material amendments thereto, which would be updated by the Commission 
each time a filing is uploaded to the station�s online public inspection file.1096
364. We find that the online public filing requirement, pursuant to Section 73.3526 of the 
Commission�s rules, best facilitates the disclosure of SSAs.1097 In the Enhanced Disclosure Order, the 
Commission updated the disclosure requirements to make information concerning broadcast service more 
accessible to the public by having stations post their public files online in a central, Commission-hosted 
database.1098 Consistent with our findings in that order, we find that an online public filing requirement 
best comports with Commission policy to modernize the procedures that television broadcasters use to 
inform the public about how stations are serving their communities.1099 Having stations post their SSAs 
online in a central, Commission-hosted database utilizes existing technology to make information 
concerning broadcast service more accessible to the public and reduces broadcasters� costs of compliance 
over time.1100 We are not convinced that other disclosure methods, such as an ECFS docket or filing with 
the Commission pursuant to Section 73.3613 of the Commission�s rules, are less burdensome than the 
online public file requirement or that such methods provide meaningful advantages to the public and the 
Commission in terms of identifying and accessing SSAs. 
365. NAB asserts that under the State Farm decision the Commission must consider less-
restrictive alternatives than those proposed in the FNPRM and proposes that stations instead submit an 
aggregate list of SSAs in their biennial ownership reports, which, according to NAB, would give the 
Commission the ability to evaluate, over time, whether these agreements have a negative impact on the 
Commission�s policy goals.1101 In reply, however, UCC et al. assert that NAB�s proposal is insufficient, 
as an aggregate list of agreements would not provide the public or the Commission with information 
regarding the content or the scope of the agreements�information that is critical for an analysis of the 
impact of SSAs on the Commission�s rules and policy goals.1102 UCC et al. also assert that the 
Commission is not required to consider other solutions to a problem, so long as the option selected is not 
irrational.1103 Moreover, UCC et al. state that NAB�s reliance on State Farm is misplaced, because 
NAB�s proposal does not address the problems identified by the Commission�i.e., a lack of information 
regarding the breadth, content, and scope of SSAs�therefore, NAB�s proposal cannot be considered a 
significant alternative worthy of Commission consideration.1104
366. We decline to adopt NAB�s proposed alternative to require that stations submit an 
aggregate list of SSAs as part of the biennial ownership reports.  We agree with UCC et al. that a mere list 
of agreements would be insufficient for the purpose we seek.1105 Such a limited disclosure would not 
permit the public or the Commission to develop a full and complete understanding of SSAs and their 
impact on the broadcast television industry.  Simply submitting a list of agreements would not provide the 
public or the Commission with any information about the nature and scope of the agreements, only that 
the agreements exist.  While the prevalence of SSAs is of some importance, the terms of the agreements

and their impact on station operations are far more critical to an analysis of the potential impact of SSAs 
on the Commission�s rules and policy goals.  In addition, disclosure only in biennial ownership reports 
would not result in timely disclosure of these agreements, which would frustrate continued efforts to 
study SSAs.  Moreover, searching for SSAs disclosed in biennial ownership reports would be a more 
laborious task for the public and the Commission than searching the online public files.  Indeed, a 
significant benefit of the online public file is that it improves public access to documents while 
minimizing burdens on stations. NAB�s proposal ignores this significant benefit without identifying any 
meaningful benefits in return.
367. Disclosure by noncommercial stations, radio, and newspapers.  In the FNPRM, we 
proposed to apply the disclosure requirement to commercial television stations only but sought comment 
on whether agreements involving other entities, such as radio stations and noncommercial television 
stations, should also be included in the disclosure requirement.1106 Some commenters urge the 
Commission to expand the disclosure requirement beyond full-power commercial television stations.  
These commenters argue that expanding the disclosure requirement will allow the public and the 
Commission to analyze whether these SSAs are impacting the Commission�s rules and policies with
regard to other media platforms.  Specifically, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) asks the 
Commission to require disclosure of SSAs involving noncommercial television stations as well as 
broadcast radio stations; SAG-AFTRA advocates expanding the requirement to commercial radio 
stations; and UCC et al. support expanding the disclosure requirement to SSAs involving same-market 
television stations and daily newspapers, and those involving same-market radio stations.1107
368. We decline to expand the SSA disclosure requirement beyond commercial television 
stations, as commenters have not provided sufficient justification for such an expansion at this time.1108  
Commenters provided the Commission with numerous examples of sharing agreements involving 
commercial television stations.1109 Based on these examples, commenters raised meaningful concerns 
about the potential impact of such agreements on the Commission�s public interest goals.1110 The 
evidence in the record, however, does not demonstrate that SSAs involving noncommercial stations, radio 
stations, or newspapers are common or that they present the same kinds of potential public interest 
concerns.  However, we may revisit our decision to limit disclosure to commercial television stations in 
the future if evidence suggests that additional disclosure may be appropriate.
369. Redaction of confidential or proprietary information.  As part of the SSA disclosure 
requirement, we adopt provisions that permit stations to redact confidential or proprietary information, 
just as we have for LMAs and JSAs.1111 We note, however, that the redacted information must be made 
available to the Commission upon request.  The redaction allowance directly addresses the concerns of 
commenters that oppose the disclosure of SSAs on the grounds that it will require stations to disclose 
sensitive, confidential business information.1112

370. NAB nevertheless argues that the redaction allowance proposed in the FNPRM is not 
sufficient to protect the business interests of stations that are subject to the disclosure requirement.1113  
NAB argues that the disclosure of the mere existence of SSAs will provide competitive information to 
competitors.1114 In reply, UCC et al. assert that the potential disclosure of sensitive business information 
is not a sufficient reason to abandon the proposed disclosure requirement, as the public and the 
Commission need to know the content of these agreements in order to evaluate their impact on the public 
interest.1115  CWA asks that the Commission carefully scrutinize redacted material if a dispute arises and 
hold that information that �is not financial in nature will be presumptively non-confidential or 
proprietary.�1116
371. We reject NAB�s argument that the redaction allowance will not be sufficient to protect 
broadcast stations� business interests because the disclosure of the mere existence of these agreements 
will provide useful information to competitors.1117 All broadcasters have long been required to attach 
copies of transaction-related SSAs to a license assignment or transfer application, including placing the 
application and relevant agreements in the station�s public inspection file until final action has been taken 
on the application.1118 There is no evidence in the record that this requirement has resulted in any 
competitive harm.  In addition, we note that broadcast commenters have failed to provide evidence that 
the business interests of television broadcast stations have been inhibited by the adoption of the LMA and 
JSA disclosure requirements or that such interests are likely to be inhibited by the substantially similar 
SSA disclosure requirement adopted today.  Furthermore, we find that NAB�s argument is at odds with its 
own proposed alternative for stations to submit aggregate lists of SSAs as part of their biennial ownership 
reports, which would disclose the existence of such agreements.1119 We conclude that the adopted 
redaction allowance sufficiently balances the informational needs of the public and the Commission with 
the business interests of broadcasters to keep proprietary information confidential. 
372. Cost of compliance.  In the FNPRM, we requested comment on alternative filing methods 
and their associated costs.1120  NAB, however, criticizes the Commission for failing to inquire whether the 
benefits of disclosure will outweigh the costs of compliance, argues that the costs will exceed the benefits, 
and disputes the Commission�s rationale that the costs will not be significant because the requirement is 
limited to commercial television stations and because SSAs are typically multi-year agreements.1121  
However, Free Press asserts that the costs and effort associated with the proposed disclosure requirement 
will be minimal and the benefits of transparency will outweigh the costs.1122
373. Consistent with Commission precedent, we find that an online public filing requirement 
minimizes the cost to broadcasters while ensuring that the public has easy and convenient access to the 
information.  As the Commission has previously stated, we find that the electronic upload or scanning and 
upload of SSAs is not unduly burdensome.1123 We do not find arguments to the contrary to be persuasive

or supported by evidence.  Aside from general statements that disclosure will be too costly, NAB and the 
Smaller Market Coalition provide no cost estimates to support their assertions.1124 Moreover, in light of 
our clarifications above, we find that we have adequately addressed concerns that the definition of SSAs 
is overly broad and would result in a significant increase in the number of agreements stations would be 
required to upload to their public inspection file.1125 Television broadcasters should also be well versed in 
uploading documents to the Commission�s online public inspection file database, as they have been 
required to use the database since 2012.1126  
374. Duplicative filings. As the Commission already requires broadcasters to submit JSAs and 
LMAs in accordance with its public file disclosure requirements,1127 we confirm that, to the extent that the 
SSA disclosure requirement would duplicate established JSA and LMA disclosures, a broadcaster would 
have to place these agreements in their public inspection file only once.  A broadcaster will not be 
required to file additional copies of JSAs and LMAs for the SSA disclosure requirement if the 
broadcaster�s public inspection file already contains a copy of the agreement.  This clarification reduces 
the burden of compliance to broadcasters and is consistent with previous Commission decisions regarding 
duplicative filings.1128
375. Procedural matters.  Each station that is party to an SSA executed prior to the effective 
date of the disclosure requirement we adopt herein, which is subject to OMB approval, shall place a copy 
of the SSA in its public inspection file within 180 days after the disclosure requirement becomes 
effective, provided that the agreement is not already in the station�s public inspection file.1129 SSAs that 
are executed after the disclosure requirement is effective must be placed in the stations� online public files 
in a timely fashion, and stations are reminded to maintain orderly public files.1130
3. Attribution
376. Finally, in response to the FNPRM, multiple commenters assert that the Commission 
should immediately make SSAs attributable based on the existing record and the Commission�s 
experience with SSAs in the context of assignments/transfers of control of station licenses.1131 These 
commenters believe that SSAs�a term that heretofore has not been defined or applied consistently�
harm the public interest and that disclosure alone is insufficient to address these harms.1132 According to

1129 See 47 CFR � 73.3526(e)(18) (as amended herein). We will seek OMB approval for the disclosure requirement, 
and, upon receiving approval, the Commission will release a Public Notice specifying the date by which SSAs must 
be placed in the stations� online public files.  The Public Notice will also provide further details on how the SSA 
files are to be designated within each station�s online public file.

these commenters, SSAs provide similar�perhaps even greater�incentives for the station providing the 
services to exert influence over the core operations of the station receiving the service than already 
attributable agreements, such as certain LMAs and JSAs.1133 Multiple broadcast commenters, however, 
urge the Commission to reject the calls to make SSAs attributable based on the existing record.1134   
377. We decline to make SSAs attributable.  As noted in the FNPRM, and as confirmed 
herein, we believe that it is necessary to first define SSAs and to require their disclosure before making 
any decisions regarding attribution or any other regulatory action that may be appropriate based on review 
of these agreements.1135 Unlike the resource sharing provided for in LMAs and JSAs�which are specific 
types of SSAs involving discrete, easily defined activities with a clear impact on a station�s core operating 
functions�the types of resource sharing in other SSAs are not easily categorized and their potential 
impact on a station�s core operating functions is not well understood at this time, largely due to the lack of 
a definition of SSAs and lack of disclosure.1136 Accordingly, our action today is a necessary step before 
the Commission can consider whether attribution of any additional types of SSAs or any other regulatory 
action is appropriate.  The Commission has traditionally taken an incremental approach in determining 
whether and how to attribute agreements between and among broadcasters.1137 In these circumstances, we 
find that it is appropriate and reasonable to proceed in this fashion, �one step at a time,� when addressing 
these complicated issues.1138 Once the Commission has had an opportunity to evaluate the potential 
impact of SSAs on the Commission�s rules and policy goals, it will be in a position to consider whether 
attribution or other regulatory action is warranted.
VI. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
A. Regulatory Flexibility Act
378. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.  As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 
1980, as amended (RFA),1139 the Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
(FRFA) of the possible significant economic impact on small entities of the policies and rules addressed 
in the Report and Order.  The FRFA is set forth in Appendix B.
B. Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis
379. Final Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis.  This Report and Order contains information 
collection requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), Public Law 104-13. The 
requirements will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under Section 
3507(d) of the PRA. OMB, the general public, and other Federal agencies will be invited to comment on 
the information collection requirements contained in this proceeding. The Commission will publish a 
separate document in the Federal Register at a later date seeking these comments. In addition, we note

Commission was justified in its sequential approach in addressing this issue.  Prometheus III, 824 F.3d at 60 n.18.

that pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44 U.S.C. � 
3506(c)(4), the Commission previously sought specific comment on how it might further reduce the 
information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.  In this present 
document, we have assessed the effects of the SSA disclosure requirement, and find that the disclosure 
requirement will not impose a significant filing burden on businesses with fewer than 25 employees.  In 
addition, we have described impacts that might affect small businesses, which includes most businesses 
with fewer than 25 employees, in the FRFA set forth in Appendix B.

� 73.3526 Local public inspection file of commercial stations.
* * * * *
(18) Shared Service Agreements.  For commercial television stations, a copy of every Shared Service 
Agreement for the station (with the substance of oral agreements reported in writing), regardless of 
whether the agreement involves commercial television stations in the same market or in different markets, 
with confidential or proprietary information redacted where appropriate.  For purposes of this paragraph, 
a Shared Service Agreement is any agreement or series of agreements in which (1) a station provides any 
station-related services, including, but not limited to, administrative, technical, sales, and/or programming 
support, to a station that is not directly or indirectly under common de jure control permitted under the 
Commission�s regulations; or (2) stations that are not directly or indirectly under common de jure control 
permitted under the Commission�s regulations collaborate to provide or enable the provision of station-
related services, including, but not limited to, administrative, technical, sales, and/or programming 
support, to one or more of the collaborating stations.  For purposes of this paragraph, the term �station� 
includes the licensee, including any subsidiaries and affiliates, and any other individual or entity with an 
attributable interest in the station.

(d)(1), and (d)(2); revising Note 4 and Note 5; and adding Note 11 and Note 12: 
� 73.3555 Multiple ownership.
* * * * *
(b) Local television multiple ownership rule.  An entity may directly or indirectly own, operate, or control
two television stations licensed in the same Designated Market Area (DMA) (as determined by Nielsen 
Media Research or any successor entity) if:
(1) The digital noise limited service contours of the stations (computed in accordance with � 73.622(e)) 
do not overlap; or 
*  * *
(ii) At least 8 independently owned and operating, full-power commercial and noncommercial TV 
stations would remain post-merger in the DMA in which the communities of license of the TV 
stations in question are located. Count only those TV stations the digital noise limited service 
Federal Communications Commission FCC 16-107
163
contours of which overlap with the digital noise limited service contour of at least one of the stations 
in the proposed combination.  In areas where there is no DMA, count the TV stations present in an 
area that would be the functional equivalent of a TV market.  Count only those TV stations digital 
noise limited service contours of which overlap with the digital noise limited service contour of at 
least one of the stations in the proposed combination. 
(2) [Reserved]
* * * * *
(c) Radio-television cross-ownership rule. 
(1) This rule is triggered when:
(i) The predicted or measured 1 mV/m contour of an existing or proposed FM station (computed in 
accordance with � 73.313) encompasses the entire community of license of an existing or proposed 
commonly owned TV broadcast station(s), or the principal community contour(s) of the TV broadcast 
station(s) (computed in accordance with � 73.625) encompasses the entire community of license of 
the FM station; or
(ii) The predicted or measured 2 mV/m groundwave contour of an existing or proposed AM station 
(computed in accordance with � 73.183 or � 73.186), encompasses the entire community of license of 
an existing or proposed commonly owned TV broadcast station(s), or the principal community 
contour(s) of the TV broadcast station(s) (computed in accordance with � 73.625) encompass(es) the 
entire community of license of the AM station.
* * *
(3) To determine how many media voices would remain in the market, count the following:
(i) TV stations: independently owned and operating full-power broadcast TV stations within the 
DMA of the TV station�s (or stations�) community (or communities) of license that have digital noise 
limited service contours (computed in accordance with � 73.622(e)) that overlap with the digital noise 
limited service contour(s) of the TV station(s) at issue;
* * * * *
(d) Newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule.  (1) No party (including all parties under common 
control) may directly or indirectly own, operate, or control a daily newspaper and a full-power 
commercial broadcast station (AM, FM, or TV) if:
(i) the predicted or measured 2 mV/m groundwave contour of the AM station (computed in 
accordance with � 73.183 or � 73.186) encompasses the entire community in which the newspaper is 
published and, in areas designated as Nielsen Audio Metro markets, the AM station and the 
community of publication of the newspaper are located in the same Nielsen Audio Metro market;
(ii) the predicted or measured 1 mV/m contour of the FM station (computed in accordance with 
� 73.313) encompasses the entire community in which the newspaper is published and, in areas 
designated as Nielsen Audio Metro markets, the FM station and the community of publication of the 
newspaper are located in the same Nielsen Audio Metro market; or
(iii) the principal community contour of the TV station (computed in accordance with � 73.625) 
encompasses the entire community in which the newspaper is published; and the community of 
Federal Communications Commission FCC 16-107
164
license of the TV station and the community of publication of the newspaper are located in the same 
DMA.
(2) The prohibition in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not apply upon a showing that either the 
newspaper or television station is failed or failing.
* * * * *
Note 4 to � 73.3555:
Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section will not be applied so as to require divestiture, by any licensee, 
of existing facilities, and will not apply to applications for assignment of license or transfer of control
filed in accordance with � 73.3540(f) or � 73.3541(b), or to applications for assignment of license or 
transfer of control to heirs or legatees by will or intestacy, or to FM or AM broadcast minor modification 
applications for intra-market community of license changes, if no new or increased concentration of 
ownership would be created among commonly owned, operated or controlled media properties. 
Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section will apply to all applications for new stations, to all other 
applications for assignment or transfer, to all applications for major changes to existing stations, and to all 
other applications for minor changes to existing stations that seek a change in an FM or AM radio 
station�s community of license or create new or increased concentration of ownership among commonly 
owned, operated or controlled media properties. Commonly owned, operated or controlled media 
properties that do not comply with paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section may not be assigned or 
transferred to a single person, group or entity, except as provided in this Note, the Report and Order in 
Docket No. 02-277, released July 2, 2003 (FCC 02-127), or the Second Report and Order in MB Docket 
No. 14-50, FCC 16-107 (released August 25, 2016).  
* * * * *
Note 5 to � 73.3555:
Paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section will not be applied to cases involving television stations that are 
�satellite� operations. Such cases will be considered in accordance with the analysis set forth in the 
Report and Order in MM Docket No. 87-8, FCC 91-182 (released July 8, 1991), in order to determine 
whether common ownership, operation, or control of the stations in question would be in the public 
interest. An authorized and operating �satellite� television station, the digital noise limited service contour 
of which overlaps that of a commonly owned, operated, or controlled �non-satellite� parent television 
broadcast station, or the principal community contour of which completely encompasses the community 
of publication of a commonly owned, operated, or controlled daily newspaper, or the community of 
license of a commonly owned, operated, or controlled AM or FM broadcast station, or the community of 
license of which is completely encompassed by the 2 mV/m contour of such AM broadcast station or the 
1 mV/m contour of such FM broadcast station, may subsequently become a �non-satellite� station under 
the circumstances described in the aforementioned Report and Order in MM Docket No. 87-8. However, 
such commonly owned, operated, or controlled �non-satellite� television stations and AM or FM stations 
with the aforementioned community encompassment, may not be transferred or assigned to a single 
person, group, or entity except as provided in Note 4 of this section. Nor shall any application for 
assignment or transfer concerning such �non-satellite� stations be granted if the assignment or transfer 
would be to the same person, group or entity to which the commonly owned, operated, or controlled 
newspaper is proposed to be transferred, except as provided in Note 4 of this section.  
* * * * *
Note 11 to � 73.3555: An entity will not be permitted to directly or indirectly own, operate, or control 
two television stations in the same DMA through the execution of any agreement (or series of
Federal Communications Commission FCC 16-107
165
agreements) involving stations in the same DMA, or any individual or entity with a cognizable interest in 
such stations, in which a station (the �new affiliate�) acquires the network affiliation of another station 
(the �previous affiliate�), if the change in network affiliations would result in the licensee of the new 
affiliate, or any individual or entity with a cognizable interest in the new affiliate, directly or indirectly 
owning, operating, or controlling two of the top-four rated television stations in the DMA at the time of 
the agreement.  Parties should also refer to the Second Report and Order in MB Docket No. 14-50, FCC 
16-107 (released August 25, 2016).  
Note 12 to � 73.3555:  Parties seeking waiver of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or an exception pursuant 
to paragraph (d)(2) of this section involving failed or failing properties, should refer to the Second Report 
and Order in MB Docket No. 14-50, FCC 16-107 (released August 25, 2016).

APPENDIX B
Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 an Initial 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) was incorporated in the NPRM that initiated this proceeding.2  
The Commission sought written public comment on the proposals in the NPRM, including comment on 
the IRFA.  In addition, the Commission incorporated a Supplemental Initial Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis (SIRFA) in the FNPRM in this proceeding.3 The Commission sought written public comment 
on the proposals in the FNPRM, including comment on the SIRFA.  The Commission received no 
comments in direct response to the IRFA or the SIRFA.  This present Final Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis (FRFA) conforms to the RFA.4
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Second Report and Order
2. The Second Report and Order (Order) concludes the 2010 and 2014 Quadrennial 
Reviews of the broadcast ownership rules, which were initiated pursuant to Section 202(h) of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act).5 The Commission is required by statute to review its media 
ownership rules every four years to determine whether they �are necessary in the public interest as the 
result of competition�6 and to �repeal or modify any regulation it determines to be no longer in the public 
interest.�7

6 1996 Act � 202(h).  In Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC, 373 F.3d 372 (3d Cir. 2004) (Prometheus I), the Third 
Circuit concluded that �necessary in the public interest� is a ��plain public interest� standard under which 
�necessary� means �convenient,� �useful,� or �helpful,� not �essential� or �indispensable.��  Id. at 394. The court 
stated that �the first instruction [of � 202(h)] requires the Commission to take a fresh look at its regulations 
periodically in order to ensure that they remain �necessary in the public interest.��  Id. at 391.  In 2004, Congress 
revised the then-biennial review requirement to require such reviews quadrennially.  See Appropriations Act � 629.
7 47 U.S.C. � 303 note (Section 202(h) of the 1996 Act as amended).  Contrary to the claims of certain commenters, 
there is no �presumption [in Section 202(h)] in favor of repealing or modifying the ownership rules.�  See, e.g., CBS 
NPRM Comments at 2-3 (citing Fox Television Stations v. FCC, 280 F.3d 1027, 1048 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Sinclair 
Broad. Group, Inc. v. FCC, 284 F.3d 148, 159 (D.C. Cir. 2002)).  The court in Prometheus I determined that Section 
202(h) does not carry a presumption in favor of deregulation.  See Prometheus I, 373 F.3d at 395 (rejecting the 
�misguided� findings in Fox and Sinclair regarding a �deregulatory presumption� in Section 202(h)); see also 
Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC, 652 F.3d 431, 444-45 (3d Cir. 2011) (Prometheus II) (confirming the standard of 
review under Section 202(h) adopted in Prometheus I).  Moreover, when modifying an existing rule, the 
Commission has the discretion �to make [the rule] more or less stringent�; Section 202(h) is not a �one-way 
ratchet.�  Prometheus I, 373 F.3d at 394-95; see also Prometheus II, 652 F.3d at 445.  Whether the Commission 
determines that a rule should be retained, repealed, or modified, the decision must be in the public interest and must 
be supported by reasoned analysis.  See Prometheus I, 373 F.3d at 395; Prometheus II, 652 F.3d at 445.

3. The media ownership rules that are subject to this quadrennial review are the Local 
Television Ownership Rule, the Local Radio Ownership Rule, the Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-
Ownership (NBCO) Rule, the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule, and the Dual Network Rule.8  
Ultimately, while the Commission acknowledged the impact of new technologies on the media 
marketplace, it concluded that some limits on broadcast ownership remain necessary to protect and 
promote the Commission�s policy goals of fostering competition, localism, and diversity.  As discussed in 
more detail below, the Order retains two rules without modification�the Local Radio Ownership Rule 
and the Dual Network Rule�and adopts changes to three others�the Local Television Ownership Rule, 
the NBCO Rule, and the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule.  In particular, the Order adopts a new 
waiver standard for the NBCO Rule and changes to the contours and market definitions used in 
application of the rule.  The Order also adopts contour changes to the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership 
Rule.  In addition, the Order adopts a definition of and disclosure requirements for shared service 
agreements (SSAs).  Lastly, the Order addresses issues referred to us in the Third Circuit�s remand in 
Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC (Prometheus II)9 of certain aspects of the Commission�s 2008 
Diversity Order.10
4. Local Television Ownership Rule.  In the Order, the Commission finds that the current 
Local Television Ownership Rule remains necessary in the public interest and should be retained with a 
limited modification.11 Specifically, the Commission finds that the public interest would be best served 
by replacing the Grade B contour overlap test used to determine when to apply the Local Television 
Ownership Rule with a digital noise limited service contour (NLSC) test�as proposed in the FNPRM�
rather than the DMA-based approach proposed in the NPRM.  The Order adopts grandfathering 
provisions for any existing combinations that violate the revised rule, though such combinations must 
comply with the rule in effect at the time of any subsequent assignment or transfer of control.
5. The Commission finds that Local Television Ownership Rule is necessary to promote 
competition.  In addition, the Commission finds that the competition-based rule adopted in this Order will 
also promote viewpoint diversity by helping to ensure the presence of independently owned broadcast 
television stations in local markets and is consistent with the Commission�s localism goal, though the 
Order does not rely on these goals to retain the rule.  Furthermore, the Order finds that extending the 
application of the top four-prohibition to affiliation swaps will help enforce the existing Local Television 
Ownership Rule.  The Commission ultimately concludes that the limited modification of the rule will 
better promote competition, and that this benefit outweighs any burdens, which are minimized further by 
the grandfathering provisions.
6. The Order also concludes that the Local Television Ownership Rule proposed in the 
FNPRM remains consistent with the goal of promoting minority and female ownership of broadcast 
television stations.  In addition, while the Order does not retain the rule with the specific purpose of 
preserving the current levels of minority and female ownership, it finds that retaining the existing rule

of Proposed Rulemaking, 23 FCC Rcd 5922 (2008) (Diversity Order and Diversity Third FNPRM).
11 47 U.S.C. � 303 note (Section 202(h) of the 1996 Act as amended).  Under the modified television ownership rule 
adopted in the Order, an entity may own up to two television stations in the same DMA if (1) the digital NLSCs of 
the stations (as determined by Section 73.622(e) of the Commission�s rules) do not overlap; or (2) at least one of the 
stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the market and at least eight independently owned television 
stations will remain in the DMA following the combination.  In calculating the number of stations remaining post-
merger, only those stations whose digital NLSC overlaps with the digital NLSC of at least one of the stations in the 
proposed combination will be considered, which is consistent with the contour overlap provision of the previous 
rule.  In addition, the Commission retains the existing failed/failing station waiver policy.  
Federal Communications Commission FCC 16-107
168
effectively addresses the concerns of those commenters who suggested that additional consolidation 
would have a negative impact on minority and female ownership of broadcast television stations.  
7. The Commission also concludes that retaining the existing failed/failing station waiver 
criteria is in the public interest.  The Commission evaluated the various proposed waiver standards 
proffered by commenters and expressed concern that many of the proposed waiver criteria would be 
difficult to monitor or enforce, are not rationally related to the ability of each station to compete in the 
local market, and could be manipulated in order to obtain a waiver.  Ultimately, the Commission predicts 
that such standards would significantly expand the circumstances in which a waiver of the Local 
Television Ownership Rule would be granted.  The Order finds that such expansion is inconsistent with 
the decision to retain the existing television ownership limits.  Moreover, the Commission believes that 
the existing waiver standard is not unduly restrictive and that it provides appropriate relief in markets of 
all sizes.  The Commission finds that the existing waiver criteria strike an appropriate balance between 
enforcing the ownership limits and providing relief from the rule on a case-by-case basis.
8. Local Radio Ownership Rule.  In the Order, the Commission finds that the current Local 
Radio Ownership Rule remains necessary in the public interest and should be retained without 
modification.12 The Commission finds that the rule is necessary to promote competition.  The radio 
ownership limits also promote viewpoint diversity by ensuring a sufficient number of independent radio 
voices and by preserving a market structure that facilitates and encourages new entry into the local media 
market.  Similarly, the Commission finds that a competitive local radio market helps to promote localism, 
as a competitive marketplace will lead to the selection of programming that is responsive to the needs and 
interests of the local community.  However, the Order does not rely on viewpoint diversity or localism as 
a justification for retaining the rule.  The Commission finds also that the Local Radio Ownership Rule is 
consistent with the goal of promoting minority and female ownership of broadcast radio stations.  The 
Commission ultimately concludes that these benefits outweigh any burdens that may result from the 
decision to retain the rule without modification.  
9. The Order retains the AM subcaps in order to promote new entry.  The Order finds that 
broadcast radio, in general, continues to be a more likely avenue for new entry in the media 
marketplace�including entry by small businesses and entities seeking to serve niche audiences�as a 
result of radio�s ability to more easily reach certain demographic groups and the relative affordability of 
radio stations compared to other mass media.  AM stations remain generally the least expensive option for 
entry into the radio market, often by a significant margin, and therefore permit new entry for far less 
capital investment than is required to purchase an FM station.  While some commenters suggested that 
eliminating the subcaps could result in divestiture of properties that could be acquired by new entrants, 
the Commission did not find this rationale persuasive.  
10. The Commission also finds that there continue to be technical and marketplace 
differences between AM and FM stations that justify retention of both the AM and FM subcaps to 
promote competition in local radio markets.  As the Commission has noted previously, FM stations enjoy 
technical advantages over AM stations, such as increased bandwidth and superior audio signal fidelity.  In 
addition, AM signal propagation varies with the time of day (i.e., AM signals travel much farther at night 
than during the day), and many AM stations are required to cease operation at sunset.  These 
technological differences often, but not always, result in greater listenership and revenues for FM stations.
  
12 Id. Under the local radio ownership rule, an entity may own:  (1) up to eight commercial radio stations in radio 
markets with 45 or more radio stations, no more than five of which can be in the same service (AM or FM); (2) up to 
seven commercial radio stations in radio markets with 30-44 radio stations, no more than four of which can be in the 
same service (AM or FM); (3) up to six commercial radio stations in radio markets with 15-29 radio stations, no 
more than four of which can be in the same service (AM or FM); and (4) up to five commercial radio stations in 
radio markets with 14 or fewer radio stations, no more than three of which can be in the same service (AM or FM), 
provided that an entity may not own more than 50 percent of the stations in such a market, except that an entity may 
always own a single AM and single FM station combination. 
Federal Communications Commission FCC 16-107
169
11. While the technological and marketplace differences between AM and FM stations 
generally benefit FM stations, and thus support retention of the FM subcaps, there continue to be many 
markets in which AM stations are significant radio voices.  Therefore, the Commission finds that 
retention of the existing AM subcaps is necessary to prevent a single station owner from acquiring 
excessive market power through concentration of ownership of AM stations in markets in which AM 
stations are significant radio voices.
12. In addition, the Order adopts certain clarifications and other measures designed to fulfil 
the intent of the revisions to the ownership rule adopted in the 2002 Biennial Review Order.  Specifically, 
the Order (1) clarifies the exception to the two-year waiting period for certain Nielsen Audio Market 
changes; (2) adopts an exemption from the Note 4 grandfathering requirements for �intra-Metro� 
community of license changes; and (3) redefines the Puerto Rico market.
13. Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule. The Order retains and modestly relaxes 
the NBCO Rule, which prohibits common ownership of a daily newspaper and a full-power broadcast 
station (AM, FM, or TV) within the same local market.13 The Commission concluded that the rule is 
necessary to promote viewpoint diversity at the local level because broadcast stations and daily 
newspapers remain the predominant sources of local news and information.  The Commission found that 
television stations, radio stations, and local newspapers continue to contribute in meaningful ways to 
viewpoint diversity within their communities.
14. The Order updates the geographic scope of the newspaper/television cross-ownership 
restriction by replacing its use of the analog Grade A contour with the digital principal community 
contour (PCC) and by adding a requirement that the newspaper and television station must be located 
within the same Nielsen DMA.  The Order adopts a parallel approach for newspaper/radio combinations 
that uses both a radio station�s Nielsen Audio Market, when one is defined, and the station�s service 
contour.  The Order states that the Commission will evaluate requests for waiver of the rule based on the 
individual merits of a proposed transaction, taking into consideration the totality of the circumstances.  It 
will assess each waiver request independently to determine the likely effect of the proposed transaction on 
viewpoint diversity in the local market.14 In addition, the Order creates an exception for proposed 
mergers involving a failed or failing broadcast station or newspaper.  It also provides for the 
grandfathering of combinations, if any, that are impacted by the updates to the geographic scope of the 
rule.  Finally, the Order finds that the Commission�s approach does not have a negative effect on minority 
and female broadcast ownership.  
15. Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule. The Order retains the Radio/Television Cross-
Ownership Rule, which restricts common ownership of television stations and radio stations in the same 
market based on the number of media voices in the market.15 The Commission concluded that the rule 
  
13 Id. Prior to the revisions adopted in the Order, the rule prohibited the licensing of an AM, FM, or TV broadcast 
station to a party (including all parties under common control) that directly or indirectly owns, operates, or controls 
a daily newspaper, if the entire community in which the newspaper is published would be encompassed within the 
service contour of the station, namely:  (1) the predicted or measured 2 mV/m contour of an AM station, computed 
in accordance with Section 73.183 or Section 73.186; (2) the predicted 1 mV/m contour for an FM station, computed 
in accordance with Section 73.313; or (3) the Grade A contour of a TV station, computed in accordance with Section 
73.684.  47 CFR � 73.3555(d) (2015).
14 To allow for more timely and effective public participation in a waiver proceeding, the Order stipulates that if the 
owner of a broadcast station seeks to acquire a newspaper under conditions that trigger the NBCO Rule, it must file 
a waiver request prior to consummating the acquisition, rather than at the time of its license renewal.
15 47 U.S.C. � 303 note (Section 202(h) of the 1996 Act as amended).  If at least 10 independently owned media 
voices would remain in the market post-merger, an entity may own up to two television stations and four radio 
stations.  If at least 20 independently owned media voices would remain in the market post-merger, an entity may 
own either:  (1) two television stations and six radio stations, or (2) one television station and seven radio stations.  
In all instances, entities also must comply with the local radio and local television ownership limits.  The market is 
(continued�)
Federal Communications Commission FCC 16-107
170
continues to be necessary to promote viewpoint diversity in local markets because radio stations and 
television stations continue to contribute in meaningful ways to viewpoint diversity within their 
communities.  The Order modifies the rule only to the extent necessary to update its references to two 
analog television service contours that became obsolete with the transition to digital television service.  
First, consistent with the update to the NBCO Rule, a television station�s digital PCC will be used instead 
of its analog Grade A contour when determining the rule�s trigger.16 Second, a television station�s digital 
NLSC will be used instead of its analog Grade B contour when counting the number of media voices 
remaining in the market post-merger.17 The Order provides for the grandfathering of combinations, if 
any, that are impacted by the updates to the service contours utilized in the rule.  The Order finds no 
negative impact on minority and female ownership of broadcast stations given the Commission�s decision 
to retain the rule with only these limited modifications.  
16. Dual Network Rule.  In the Order, the Commission finds that the Dual Network Rule, 
which permits common ownership of multiple broadcast networks, but prohibits a merger between or 
among the �top four� networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC), continues to be necessary to promote 
competition and localism and should be retained without modification.18   
17. The Order finds that the Dual Network Rule remains necessary in the public interest to 
foster competition in the provision of primetime entertainment programming and the sale of national 
advertising time.  Specifically, it finds that the primetime entertainment programming supplied by the top-
four broadcast networks is a distinct product, the provision of which could be restricted if two of the four 
major networks were to merge.  It also finds that, consistent with past Commission findings, the top-four 
broadcast networks comprise a �strategic group� in the national advertising market and compete largely 
among themselves for advertisers that seek to reach large, national mass audiences.  The top-four 
broadcast networks have a distinctive ability to attract, on a regular basis, larger primetime audiences than 
other broadcast and cable networks, which enables them to earn higher rates from those advertisers 
willing to pay a premium for such audiences.  Accordingly, the Commission concludes that a top-four 
network merger would substantially lessen competition for advertising dollars in the national advertising 
market, which would, in turn, reduce incentives for the networks to compete with each other for viewers 
by providing innovative, high quality programming.  Based on their distinctive characteristics relative to 
other broadcast and cable networks, the Commission finds that the top-four broadcast networks serve a 
unique role in the provision of primetime entertainment programming and the sale of national advertising 
time that justifies retaining a rule specific to them.
18. The Order also finds that, consistent with past Commission findings, the Dual Network 
Rule remains necessary to promote the Commission�s localism goal.  Specifically, the Order finds that 
the rule remains necessary to preserve the balance of bargaining power between the top-four networks 
and their affiliates, thus improving the ability of affiliates to exert influence on network programming 
(Continued from previous page)    
determined by looking at the service contours of the relevant stations.  The rule specifies how to count the number of 
media voices in a market, including television stations, radio stations, newspapers, and cable systems.  See 47 CFR 
� 73.3555(c).     
16 47 CFR � 73.625.  Prior to this change, the radio/television cross-ownership rule was triggered when a television 
station�s Grade A contour encompassed a radio station�s entire community of license.  Id. � 73.3555(c)(1)(i)-(ii).  
17 Id. � 73.622(e).  Previously, an independently owned television station was counted as a media voice remaining in 
the market post-merger if it was in same DMA as the television station(s) at issue and had a Grade B signal contour 
that overlapped with the Grade B signal contour of the television station(s) at issue.  Id. � 73.3555(c)(3)(i).
18 47 U.S.C. � 303 note (Section 202(h) of the 1996 Act as amended).  The rule provides that �[a] television 
broadcast station may affiliate with a person or entity that maintains two or more networks of television broadcast 
stations unless such dual or multiple networks are composed of two or more persons or entities that, on February 8, 
1996, were �networks� as defined in [Section] 73.3613(a)(1) of the Commission�s regulations . . . .�  47 CFR 
� 73.658(g) (emphasis in original).

decisions in a manner that best serves the interests of their local communities.  Typically, a critical role of 
a broadcast network is to provide its local affiliates with high quality programming.  Because this 
programming is distributed across the country, broadcast networks have an economic incentive to ensure 
that the programming both appeals to a mass, nationwide audience and is widely shown by affiliates.  A 
network�s local affiliates serve a complementary role by providing local input in network programming 
decisions and airing programming that serves the specific needs and interests of that specific local 
community.  As a result, the economic incentives of the networks are not always aligned with the interests 
of the local affiliates or the communities they serve.
19. Diversity Order Remand and Eligible Entity Definition.  In addition to evaluating each of 
its broadcast ownership rules, the Commission responds in the Order to the Third Circuit�s remand of 
certain aspects of its 2008 Diversity Order.  Based on analysis of the preexisting eligible entity standard 
as well as the measures to which it applied, the Third Circuit�s remand instructions, and the record in this 
proceeding, the Commission reinstates the revenue-based eligible entity standard and will apply it to the 
regulatory policies set forth in the Diversity Order.19 While the Commission recognizes that it does not 
have an evidentiary record demonstrating that this standard specifically increases minority and female 
broadcast ownership, the Commission finds that reinstating the previous revenue-based standard will 
promote small business participation in the broadcast industry.  The Commission believes that small 
businesses benefit from flexible licensing policies and that making it easier for small business applicants 
to participate in the broadcast industry will help encourage innovation and enhance viewpoint diversity.  
The Commission finds that this action will advance the policy objectives that traditionally have guided its 
analyses of broadcast ownership issues and will serve the public interest.  The Commission also 
considered and rejected, based on legal impediments and considerations relating to implementation issues, 
proposals to adopt race-conscious regulatory measures using the Small Business Administration�s (SBA) 
�socially and economically disadvantaged� definition, regulatory measures based on an �Overcoming 
Disadvantage Preference,� and additional proposals related to minority and female ownership.20
20. The changes adopted in the Order provide a comprehensive framework for broadcast 
regulation that recognizes both the dynamic changes taking place in the media marketplace as well as the 
vital roles that traditional media outlets continue to serve in local communities.  The record in this 
proceeding is replete with examples of the ways in which broadband Internet and other technologies have 
changed the way that consumers access media content.  The record, however, also firmly establishes that 
traditional media outlets continue to thrive and remain the most significant sources of local news content.  
  
19 The preexisting eligible entity standard includes those entities�commercial or noncommercial�that would 
qualify as small businesses consistent with SBA standards for its industry grouping, based on revenue.  Diversity 
Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5925-26, para. 6; see also 2002 Biennial Regulatory Review�Review of the Commission�s 
Broadcast Ownership Rules and Other Rules Adopted Pursuant to Section 202 of the Communications Act of 1996, 
Report and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 18 FCC Rcd 13620, 13810-12, paras. 488-89 (2003) (2002 
Biennial Review Order).  As the Commission previously held, going forward the Commission will include both 
commercial and noncommercial entities within the scope of the term �eligible entity� to the extent that they 
otherwise meet the criteria of this standard.  See Order at para. 286 (describing the SBA�s small business standards, 
which are used to define an �eligible entity�).  Furthermore, the Commission will readopt each of the following 
measures, which rely on the eligible entity definition and were remanded in Prometheus II:  (1) Revision of Rules 
Regarding Construction Permit Deadlines; (2) Modification of Attribution Rule; (3) Distress Sale Policy; (4) 
Duopoly Priority for Companies that Finance or Incubate an Eligible Entity; (5) Extension of Divestiture Deadline 
in Certain Mergers; and (6) Transfer of Grandfathered Radio Station Combinations.  See id. at para. 285 (describing 
these measures).
20 For the discussion of these proposals, see paragraphs 297 through 316 (considering race-conscious regulatory 
measures using the SBA�s �socially disadvantaged business� definition and regulatory measures based on an 
�Overcoming Disadvantage Preference�), 319 through 321 (considering incubator proposal), 322 (considering 
proposal to migrate AM radio to VHF Channels 5 and 6), 323 through 328 and 334 through 336 (considering 
additional proposals related to minority and female ownership) of the Order.  The Commission also determined that 
certain proposals warranted additional consideration, as discussed in paragraphs 329 through 333 of the Order.
Federal Communications Commission FCC 16-107
172
Moreover, the Commission recognizes that millions of Americans continue to lack access to sufficient 
broadband speeds necessary to take advantage of online content available via streaming or download.  For 
these consumers, many of whom reside in low income and rural areas, broadcast media serve as a critical 
source for entertainment and local news.  It is with these considerations in mind that the Commission 
adopts its broadcast media ownership rules.  The Commission believes that these rules will continue to 
promote the Commission�s longstanding policy goals of competition, localism, and diversity in the 
manner described herein.
21. Shared Service Agreements.  In the Order, the Commission adopts a definition of SSAs 
and requires commercial broadcast television stations to disclose SSAs entered into between commercial 
broadcast television stations to allow the Commission and the public to better understand the terms, 
operation, and prevalence of these agreements and their potential impact on the Commission�s 
competition, localism, and diversity goals.  Because the Commission does not currently require the filing 
or disclosure of all sharing agreements that do not contain time brokerage or joint advertising sales 
provisions, the Commission has limited information about the content or breadth of such agreements or 
the frequency of their use.  Because the Commission desires to expand the public�s knowledge of these 
agreements, it adopts a comprehensive definition of SSAs.  Commercial television stations will be 
required to place copies of such agreements in their public inspection files.  The SSA disclosure 
requirement is subject to the same redaction allowances made available to local marketing agreements 
and joint sales agreements, namely, that licensees may redact confidential or proprietary information.
B. Summary of Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments in Response to the IRFA 
and the SIRFA
22. The Commission received no comments in direct response to the IRFA or the SIRFA.
C. Response to Comments by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration
23. Pursuant to the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which amended the RFA, the 
Commission is required to respond to any comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA 
and to provide a detailed statement of any change made to the proposed rules as a result of those 
comments.21
24. The Chief Counsel did not file any comments in response to the proposed rules in this 
proceeding.
D. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which Rules Will 
Apply
25. The RFA directs the Commission to provide a description of and, where feasible, an 
estimate of the number of small entities that will be affected by the rules adopted.22 The RFA generally 
defines the term �small entity� as having the same meaning as the terms �small business,� �small 
organization,� and �small governmental jurisdiction�23 In addition, the term �small business� has the 
same meaning as the term �small business concern� under the Small Business Act.24 A �small business 
concern� is one which:  (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of 
  
21 5 U.S.C. � 604(a)(3).

24 Id. � 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of �small-business concern� in the Small Business Act, 15 
U.S.C. � 632).  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. � 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies �unless an agency, 
after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public 
comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and 
publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.�

operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.25 The final rules adopted 
herein affect small television and radio broadcast stations and small entities that operate daily 
newspapers.  A description of these small entities, as well as an estimate of the number of such small 
entities, is provided below.
26. Television Broadcasting. The SBA defines a television broadcasting station that has no 
more than $38.5 million in annual receipts as a small business.  The definition of business concerns 
included in this industry states that establishments are primarily engaged in broadcasting images together 
with sound.  These firms operate television broadcasting studios and facilities for the programming and 
transmission of programs to the public.  These firms also produce or transmit visual programming to 
affiliated broadcast television stations, which in turn broadcast the programs to the public on a 
predetermined schedule. Programming may originate in their own studio, from an affiliated network, or 
from external sources.26 Census data for 2012 indicate that 751 such firms were in operation for the 
duration of that entire year.  Of these, 656 had annual receipts of less than $25.0 million per year and 95 
had annual receipts of $25.0 million or more per year.27 Based on this data and the associated size 
standard, the Commission concludes that the majority of such firms are small.  
27. Additionally, the Commission has estimated the number of licensed commercial 
television stations to be 1,387.28 According to Commission staff review of the BIA/Kelsey, LLC�s Media 
Access Pro Television Database on June 2, 2016, about 1,264 of an estimated 1,387 commercial 
television stations (or approximately 91 percent) had revenues of $38.5 million or less.  The Commission 
has estimated the number of licensed noncommercial educational television stations to be 395.29  The 
Commission notes, however, that, in assessing whether a business concern qualifies as small under the 
above definition, business (control) affiliations30 must be included.  The Commission�s estimate, 
therefore, likely overstates the number of small entities that might be affected by its action, because the 
revenue figure on which it is based does not include or aggregate revenues from affiliated companies.  
The Commission does not compile and otherwise does not have access to information on the revenue of 
NCE stations that would permit it to determine how many such stations would qualify as small entities.
28. In addition, an element of the definition of �small business� is that the entity not be 
dominant in its field of operation.  The Commission is unable at this time to define or quantify the criteria 
that would establish whether a specific television station is dominant in its field of operation.  
Accordingly, the estimate of small businesses to which rules may apply do not exclude any television 
station from the definition of a small business on this basis and are therefore over-inclusive to that extent.  
Also, as noted, an additional element of the definition of �small business� is that the entity must be 
independently owned and operated.  The Commission notes that it is difficult at times to assess these 
criteria in the context of media entities and its estimates of small businesses to which they apply may be 
over-inclusive to this extent.

29. Radio Broadcasting.  The SBA defines a radio broadcasting entity that has $38.5 million 
or less in annual receipts as a small business.31 Business concerns included in this industry are those 
�primarily engaged in broadcasting aural programs by radio to the public.�32 Census data for 2012 
indicate that 3,187 such firms were in operation for the duration of that entire year.  Of these, 3,134 had 
annual receipts of less than $25.0 million per year and 53 had annual receipts of $25.0 million or more per 
year.33 Based on this data and the associated size standard, the Commission concludes that the majority 
of such firms are small. 
30. Further, according to Commission staff review of the BIA/Kelsey, LLC�s Media Access 
Pro Radio Database on June 2, 2016, about 11,386 (or about 99.9 percent) of 11,395 commercial radio 
stations in the United States have revenues of $38.5 million or less.  The Commission has estimated the 
number of licensed noncommercial radio stations to be 4,096.34 The Commission does not have revenue 
data or revenue estimates for these stations.  These stations rely primarily on grants and contributions for 
their operations, so it will assume that all of these entities qualify as small businesses.  The Commission 
notes, however, that, in assessing whether a business concern qualifies as small under the above 
definition, business (control) affiliations35 must be included.  The Commission�s estimate, therefore, 
likely overstates the number of small entities that might be affected by its action, because the revenue 
figure on which it is based does not include or aggregate revenues from affiliated companies.
31. In addition, an element of the definition of �small business� is that the entity not be 
dominant in its field of operation.  The Commission is unable at this time to define or quantify the criteria 
that would establish whether a specific radio station is dominant in its field of operation.  Accordingly, 
the estimate of small businesses to which rules may apply does not exclude any radio station from the 
definition of a small business on this basis and therefore may be over-inclusive to that extent.  Also, as 
noted, an additional element of the definition of �small business� is that the entity must be independently 
owned and operated.  The Commission notes that it is difficult at times to assess these criteria in the 
context of media entities and the estimates of small businesses to which they apply may be over-inclusive 
to this extent.
32. Daily Newspapers. The SBA has developed a small business size standard for the census 
category of Newspaper Publishers; that size standard is 1,000 or fewer employees.36 Business concerns 
included in this category are those that �carry out operations necessary for producing and distributing 
newspapers, including gathering news; writing news columns, feature stories, and editorials; and selling 
and preparing advertisements.�37 Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 4,466 firms in this 
category that operated for the entire year.38 Of this total, 4,378 firms had employment of 499 or fewer

employees, and an additional 88 firms had employment of 500 to 999 employees.39 Therefore, the 
Commission estimates that the majority of Newspaper Publishers are small entities that might be affected 
by its action.
E. Description of Reporting, Record Keeping, and other Compliance Requirements for 
Small Entities
33. The Order adopts rule changes that will affect reporting, recordkeeping, and other 
compliance requirements.  The need for and content of each of these rule changes is described in detail in 
Section A above and the Commission�s efforts to minimize the impact of each of these rules is described 
in detail in Section F below.  Additionally, the Order adopts a requirement that commercial broadcast 
television stations must place a copy of any SSA entered into between commercial broadcast television 
stations in their online public inspection files within 180 days after the filing requirement becomes 
effective.40 Going forward, commercial broadcast television stations must place copies of such 
agreements in their online public inspection files in a timely fashion following execution.  
34. As a result of these new or modified requirements, we do not believe that small 
businesses will need to hire additional professionals (e.g., attorneys, engineers, economists, or 
accountants) to comply with the new reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements.  For 
example, commercial television stations should already have staff capable of placing SSAs in the stations� 
online public files, given the existing public file requirements.  
F. Steps Taken to Minimize Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and 
Significant Alternatives Considered
35. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant alternatives that it has considered 
in reaching its approach, which may include the following four alternatives (among others):  (1) the 
establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the 
resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance or 
reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; (3) the use of performance, rather than design, 
standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for small entities.41
36. In conducting the quadrennial review, the Commission has three chief alternatives 
available for each of the Commission�s media ownership rules�eliminate the rule, modify it, or, if the 
Commission determines that the rule is �necessary in the public interest,� retain it.  The Commission 
finds that the rules adopted in the Order, which are intended to achieve the policy goals of competition, 
localism, and diversity, will continue to benefit small entities by fostering a media marketplace in which 
they are better able to compete and by promoting additional broadcast ownership opportunities, as 
described below, among a diverse group of owners, including small entities.  The Commission discusses 
below several ways in which the rules may benefit small entities as well as steps taken, and significant 
alternatives considered, to minimize any potential burdens on small entities.    
37. Local Television Ownership Rule (Paragraphs 17-81).  In the Order, the Commission 
finds that the Local Television Ownership Rule remains necessary in the public interest and should be 
maintained with a limited modification.  Accordingly, under the modified television ownership rule an 
entity may own up to two television stations in the same DMA if (1) the digital noise limited service 
contours (NLSCs) of the stations (as determined by Section 73.622(e)) do not overlap; or (2) at least one

of the stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the market and at least eight independently 
owned television stations will remain in the DMA following the combination.42 In calculating the number 
of stations remaining post-merger, only those stations whose digital NLSC overlaps with the digital 
NLSC of at least one of the stations in the proposed combination will be considered.  In addition, the 
Commission retains the existing failed/failing station waiver policy.  
38. In the Order, the Commission affirms the FNPRM�s proposal to grandfather existing 
ownership combinations that would exceed the numerical limits under the revised contour approach, 
though it finds that, going forward, the sale of such combinations must comply with the Local Television 
Ownership Rule then in effect.  The Commission finds that this approach will avoid disruption of settled 
expectations and prevent any impact on the provision of television service by smaller stations operating in 
rural areas.  Moreover, the Commission finds that by preventing stations with the largest market shares 
from combining to achieve excessive market power, the Local Television Ownership Rule protects 
against potential harm to broadcasters with smaller market shares, including small entities.  Accordingly, 
the Commission finds that the rule, as modified, will continue to help ensure that local television markets 
do not become too concentrated and, by doing so, will allow more firms, including those that are small 
entities, to enter local markets and compete effectively.
39. The Order also addresses the competitive challenges faced by broadcasters that operate in 
small markets�including small entities�by retaining the existing failed/failing station waiver policy.  
The Order finds that the existing waiver standard is not unduly restrictive and provides appropriate relief 
in markets of all sizes.  In particular, the Commission notes that a review of recent transactions 
demonstrates that waivers under the failed/failing station policy are frequently granted in small and mid-
sized markets, which often provides relief for small entities.43 Moreover, the Commission finds that the 
existing waiver criteria strike an appropriate balance between enforcing the ownership limits and 
providing relief from the rule in circumstances where it is truly appropriate.    
40. Local Radio Ownership Rule (Paragraphs 82-128).  In the Order, the Commission 
retains the Local Radio Ownership Rule, including the AM/FM subcaps, finding that AM subcaps in 
particular promote new entry in the broadcast radio marketplace.  Accordingly, an entity may own:  (1) up 
to eight commercial radio stations in radio markets with 45 or more radio stations, no more than five of 
which can be in the same service (AM or FM); (2) up to seven commercial radio stations in radio markets 
with 30-44 radio stations, no more than four of which can be in the same service (AM or FM); (3) up to 
six commercial radio stations in radio markets with 15-29 radio stations, no more than four of which can 
be in the same service (AM or FM); and (4) up to five commercial radio stations in radio markets with 14 
or fewer radio stations, no more than three of which can be in the same service (AM or FM), provided 
that an entity may not own more than 50 percent of the stations in such a market, except that an entity 
may always own a single AM and single FM station combination.44

41. The Order concludes that, consistent with previous Commission findings, broadcast radio 
continues to be a viable avenue for new entry in the media marketplace, including by small businesses, 
minorities, women, and entities seeking to serve niche audiences.  Specifically, the Commission finds that 
AM stations are generally the least expensive option for entry into the radio market, often by a significant 
margin, and therefore permit new entry for far less capital investment than is required to purchase an FM 
station.  The Commission finds that retention of the local radio ownership limits, including the AM/FM 
subcaps, will help foster opportunities for new entry in local radio markets, including by small entities.  
Moreover, the Commission believes that by limiting the consolidation of market power among the 
dominant groups, the rule will help ensure that small radio station owners remain economically viable.
42. Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule (Paragraphs 129-197).  In several ways, 
the Commission�s decisions regarding the NBCO Rule minimize the economic impact on small entities, 
namely small broadcasters and newspaper owners.  First, retaining the prohibition on 
newspaper/broadcast combinations in local markets will help small entities compete on more equal 
footing with larger media owners that may have pursued consolidation strategies through cross-
ownership.  Several commenters expressed concern that permitting consolidation by relaxing or 
eliminating all or part of the rule would have harmed small broadcast stations, including those owned by 
women and minorities, and reduced opportunities for new small businesses to enter the market.45 Second, 
by entertaining waiver requests on a pure case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the totality of 
circumstances surrounding a proposed transaction and the potential harm to viewpoint diversity, the 
Commission will have the flexibility to accord the proper weight to any factors that are particularly 
relevant for small media owners.  The significant alternatives that the Commission considered, such as 
allowing combinations under either a bright-line rule or a presumptive waiver standard, would not have 
afforded the Commission the same degree of flexibility.  Third, adopting a more lenient approach for 
proposed combinations involving a failed or failing broadcast station or newspaper will benefit entities in 
financial distress, which may be more likely to include small entities.  Fourth, grandfathering existing 
combinations will avoid disruption of settled expectations of existing licensees and prevent any impact on 
the provision of service by smaller entities that are part of such combinations.  Finally, requiring 
subsequent purchasers of grandfathered combinations to comply with the rule in effect at that time will 
provide opportunities for new entrants to acquire a divested media outlet.  
43. Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule (Paragraphs 198-215).  By retaining the 
Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule, the Commission minimizes the economic impact on small 
entities.  The Commission considered the significant alternative of eliminating the rule but concluded that 
it remained necessary to promote viewpoint diversity.  Retaining the rule will benefit small broadcast 
stations by limiting the growth of existing combinations of radio stations and television stations in local 
markets.  In addition, grandfathering existing combinations will avoid disruption of settled expectations 
of existing licensees and prevent any impact on the provision of service by smaller stations that are part of 
such combinations; requiring subsequent purchasers of grandfathered combinations to comply with the 
rule in effect at that time will provide opportunities for new entrants to acquire a divested media outlet.  
The Commission�s decision also alleviates the concern expressed by commenters that further 
consolidation would harm small businesses because radio provides one of the few entry points into media 
ownership for minorities and women.46
44. Dual Network Rule (Paragraphs 216-233).  In the Order, the Commission retains the 
Dual Network Rule without modification.  As noted above, the Order concludes that a combination 
between top-four broadcast networks would reduce the choices available to advertisers seeking large, 
  
45 See, e.g., Free Press FNPRM Comments at 12-13; Association of Free Community Papers FNPRM Comments at 
3-4, 8-9 (AFCP); Writers Guild of America, West FNPRM Comments at 10-11 (WGAW); National Hispanic Media 
Coalition FNPRM Comments at 7, 12-13 (NHMC); UCC et al. FNPRM Comments at 41-42; National Association

178
national audiences, which could substantially lessen competition and lead the networks to pay less 
attention to viewer demand for innovative, high quality programming.  Furthermore, the Commission 
finds that the rule remains necessary to preserve the balance of bargaining power between the top-four 
networks and their affiliates, thus improving the ability of affiliates to exert influence on network 
programming decisions in a manner that best serves the interests of their local communities.  The 
Commission believes that these benefits to affiliates are particularly important for small entities that may 
otherwise lack bargaining power.
45. Diversity Order Remand/Eligible Entity Definition (Paragraphs 234-336).  As noted 
above, the Order concludes that the Commission should reinstate the preexisting revenue-based eligible 
entity definition, which includes those entities�commercial or noncommercial�that would qualify as 
small businesses consistent with SBA standards for its industry grouping, based on revenue.47  
Specifically, the Commission finds that reinstating the revenue-based standard will help promote small 
business participation in the broadcast industry.  The Commission believes that small-sized applicants and 
licensees benefit from flexible licensing, auctions, transactions, and construction policies.  Often, small-
business applicants have financing and operational needs distinct from those of larger broadcasters.  By 
easing certain regulations for small broadcasters, the Commission believes that it will promote the public 
interest goal of making access to broadcast spectrum available to a broad range of applicants.  The 
Commission also believes that enabling more small businesses to participate in the broadcast industry will 
help encourage innovation and expand viewpoint diversity.
46. In addition, the Commission will readopt each measure relying on the eligible entity 
definition that was remanded in Prometheus II.  These measures include:  (1) Revision of Rules 
Regarding Construction Permit Deadlines;48 (2) Modification of Attribution Rule;49 (3) Distress Sale 
Policy;50 (4) Duopoly Priority for Companies that Finance or Incubate an Eligible Entity;51 (5) Extension 
  
47 Diversity Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5925-26, para. 6; see also 2002 Biennial Review Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 13810-12, 
paras. 488-89.  As the Commission previously held, going forward the Commission will include both commercial 
and noncommercial entities within the scope of the term �eligible entity� to the extent that they otherwise meet the 
criteria of this standard.  See Order at para. 286 (describing the SBA�s small business standards, which are used to 
define an �eligible entity�).
48 Diversity Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5930, para. 15 (revising construction permit rules to allow the sale of expiring 
construction permits to eligible entities that agree to complete construction within the time remaining on the permit 
or within 18 months, whichever period is greater); see also 47 CFR � 73.3598(a). 
49 Diversity Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5936, para. 31 (relaxing the equity/debt plus (EDP) attribution standard for 
interest holders in eligible entities by �allow[ing] the holder of an equity or debt interest in a media outlet subject to 
the media ownership rules to exceed the 33 percent threshold set forth in [the EDP standard] without triggering 
attribution where such investment would enable an eligible entity to acquire a broadcast station provided (1) the 
combined equity and debt of the interest holder in the eligible entity is less than 50 percent, or (2) the total debt of 
the interest holder in the eligible entity does not exceed 80 percent of the asset value of the station being acquired by 
the eligible entity and the interest holder does not hold any equity interest, option, or promise to acquire an equity 
interest in the eligible entity or any related entity�); see also 47 CFR � 73.3555, Note 2(i)(2).  In addition, pursuant 
to the new entrant bidding credits available under the Commission�s broadcast auction rules, the modified EDP 
attribution standard is available to interest holders in eligible entities that are the winning bidders in broadcast 
auctions.  See id. � 73.5008(c)(2).  This application of the modified EDP standard also is being reinstated by the 
Commission.  
50 Diversity Order, 23 FCC Rcd at 5939, para. 39 (modifying the distress sale policy by allowing a licensee that has
been designated for a revocation hearing or has a renewal application that has been designated for hearing on basic 
qualification issues to sell the station to an eligible entity prior to the hearing).

Federal Communications Commission FCC 16-107
179
of Divestiture Deadline in Certain Mergers;52 and (6) Transfer of Grandfathered Radio Station 
Combinations.53 The Commission�s intent in reinstating the previous revenue-based eligible entity 
definition�and in applying it to the construction, licensing, transaction, and auction measures to which it 
previously applied�is to expand broadcast ownership opportunities for new entrants, including small 
entities. Therefore, the Commission anticipates that these measures will benefit small entities, not burden 
them.  
47. Shared Services Agreements (Paragraphs 337-377).  In the Order, the Commission 
requires commercial broadcast television stations to disclose SSAs entered into between commercial 
broadcast television stations.  Commercial television stations will be required to place copies of such 
agreements in their public inspection files to allow the Commission and the public to understand better 
the terms, operation, and prevalence of these agreements and their potential impact on the Commission�s 
competition, localism, and diversity goals.  Although the Commission does not currently require the filing 
or disclosure of sharing agreements that do not contain time brokerage or joint advertising sales 
provisions, broadcasters are required to file many types of documents in their public inspection files.  
Therefore, broadcasters, including those qualifying as small entities, are well versed in the procedures 
necessary for compliance and will not be overly burdened with having to add SSAs to their public 
inspection files.  In addition, the Commission considered various disclosure alternatives in the record, but 
determined that such measures would either be more burdensome than the disclosure method adopted in 
the Order or that the proposals would not adequately address the concerns raised by the Commission.  
Ultimately, as the Commission finds that the new SSA disclosure requirement will not be especially 
burdensome to small entities, it is therefore unnecessary to adopt any special measures for small entities 
with respect to this new disclosure requirement.  
48. Reports to Congress and Government Accountability Office: The Commission will 
send a copy of the Order, including this FRFA, in a report to be sent to Congress and the Government 
Accountability Office pursuant to the Congressional Review Act.54 A copy of the Order and FRFA (or 
summaries thereof) will also be published in the Federal Register.55

Re:  2014 Quadrennial Regulatory Review � Review of the Commission�s Broadcast Ownership Rules

Last month, in the wake of the horrific shootings in Dallas, Texas, Washington, D.C. Police Chief 
Cathy Lanier held a press conference to reassure the citizens in our nation�s capital that her department 
would continue to build strong community relationships while it protects and serves. Who covered this 
press conference? Local broadcast television outlets, area radio stations, and the city�s daily and weekly 
newspapers� the ones that have been on the scene, covering these types of events for decades.1
This was not an anomaly. Broadcasters and newspapers have been and continue to play a 
uniquely relevant role in our society when it comes to covering news and events. In fact, a 2010 Pew 
Research Center study of 98 major metropolitan cities found that nearly 89 percent of news and 
information about local government came from area newspapers and local broadcast television stations.2
More to the point, this study found that over half of the 928 local stories it examined came from daily and 
weekly newspapers.3 Even more telling is what the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) stated 
earlier this year: �nobody wants to do what we do � live and vital localism.�4 Couple that statement with a 
2015 study published in the Journal of Politics which found a diminished local news environment 
depresses citizen engagement.5 It then becomes real clear, that any rule which threatens or jeopardizes 
�live and vital localism� should never see the light of day.
There is no question that our media landscape looks very different than it did thirty years ago. 
The Internet and cable news networks and other portals, have given birth to a host of options when it 
comes to news and information dissemination. Popular outlets like BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, Twitter 
and hyperlocal blogs found in communities across the country, allow Americans to consume great 
quantities of information from multiple sources. But make no mistake, more options do not necessarily 
translate into access to original local news gathering, reporting or sourcing. Using data from Nielsen, Pew 
Research Center in 2011 found that legacy news organizations, meaning those attached to another 
platform such as television or print, represent about two-thirds of the top 25 news websites.6
And yes, as the former publisher and general manager of a small Charleston-based weekly 
newspaper for 14 years, I am very much aware that the newspaper business is not what it used to be.

Nationally, the number of daily newspapers over the past 40 years has decreased by nearly 25 percent.7
Circulation has fallen from 60.7 million in 1975 to 40.4 million in 2014.8 But if the real fear is that a 
failed or failing newspaper or broadcast station will jeopardize the number of local voices in a given 
market, the Commission has adopted an exception to its newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule that 
can actually prevent these voices from vanishing by allowing for an injection of new investment capital 
into the particular news outlet. 
Further, with the broadcast incentive auction well underway, we are on the cusp of seeing major 
changes to the television landscape. While it is not publicly known which stations will participate, one 
thing is certain:  there will be fewer broadcast television stations on the air post-auction. Relaxing the 
Commission�s media ownership rules at this time, will neither increase the number of diverse stations nor 
will it create additional local voices.
What is extremely troubling to me is that despite comprising nearly 13 percent of the U.S. 
population, African Americans held a majority interest in just nine of the nearly 1,400 full power 
commercial television stations, according to data from 2013.9 While the Order tees up for further 
consideration five proposals offered by the Multicultural Media, Telecom and Internet Council (MMTC), 
which I applaud, more proactive steps must be taken. To satisfy judicial scrutiny and demonstrate the 
Commission�s commitment to ownership diversity that is so desperately wanting, we need a robust record 
of data that paints a comprehensive picture of today�s media landscape. Today, this simply does not exist.
Commenters in the record point to six categories of research that could be a starting point for a 
more comprehensive set of data examining the impact of ownership diversity.10 Some of the ideas put 
forward include looking at the impact of existing FCC policies on ownership by women and people of 
color; examining local news sharing agreements and how they affect the production of diverse and 
competitive local news; and undertaking additional research necessary to support Congressional action on 
the minority tax certificate. If we are serious about our commitment to implementing informed and 
forward-looking policies that are in the public interest, these ideas should be considered.
Everyone should stop making excuses. The Third Circuit, in its most recent decision was crystal 
clear: if more data is needed, we �must get it.� I stand ready to work with the Commission and interested 
researchers to fulfill this goal so that the Commission has the information it needs to ensure that the right 
policies are in place to promote a vibrant and diverse media landscape. Without �it�� well let me simply 
say, �the proof of the pudding is in the eating.�

�The more things change, the more they stay the same.�  When French journalist Jean-Baptiste 
Alphonse Kerr first expressed that sentiment 167 years ago, he obviously didn�t have the FCC�s media 
ownership regulations in mind.  But his words ring true as the Commission finally gets around to 
finishing the 2010 Quadrennial Review.
Congress instructed the FCC to reassess its media ownership regulations every four years.  It also 
provided that the agency �shall� get rid of outdated rules.1 This was because Congress recognized that 
regulations designed to promote localism, diversity, competition, and investment in media could have 
exactly the opposite effect if they didn�t keep up with the times.
But here, the FCC has failed on both counts.  In terms of timing, the Commission has thumbed its 
nose at Congress for the past eight-and-a-half years by refusing to complete a single quadrennial review.  
This is the regulatory equivalent of completing your figure-skating routine for the 2010 Vancouver 
Winter Olympics after the Olympic flame has been extinguished at the closing ceremony of the 2016 
Games in Rio de Janeiro.  What took us so long?  Based on the �substance� of this Order, I have no idea, 
for the agency essentially does nothing but stick its head in the sand.
The changes to the media marketplace since the FCC adopted the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-
Ownership Rule in 1975 have been revolutionary.  Over the last four decades, newspaper circulation and 
advertising revenue have plummeted, and hundreds of publications have gone out of business.  The 
Internet has become the go-to source for news.  National and regional cable news networks have 
flourished.  The days of Americans waiting for the morning newspaper to learn about what is going on 
around them are long gone.  Yet, instead of repealing the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule to 
account for the massive changes in how Americans receive news and information, we cling to it.
And over the near-decade since the FCC last finished a �quadrennial� review, the video 
marketplace has transformed dramatically.  Especially with the rise of over-the-top video, the market is 
now more competitive than ever.  Never before have Americans been able to choose from such a wide 
array of content.  They now demand to view that content when they want and on the device of their 
choice.  And high-profile news is increasingly made and distributed on online video networks that didn�t

even exist just a few years ago.2 Yet, instead of loosening the Local Television Ownership Rule to 
account for the increasing competition to broadcast television stations, we actually tighten that regulation.  
And instead of updating the Local Radio Ownership Rule, the Radio-Television Cross-Ownership 
Rule, and the Dual Network Rule, we merely rubber-stamp them.
The more the media marketplace changes, the more the FCC�s media regulations stay the same.
This ostrich of an Order is not at all what Congress envisioned.  And it is a thumb in the eye of 
the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, too.  Five years ago, the Third Circuit vacated 
the FCC�s definition of �eligible entity.�3 Earlier this year, the Third Circuit said �enough is enough�4
and demanded that the FCC take prompt action on its �stalled efforts to promote diversity in the broadcast 
industry.�5 So what does the Commission do here in response to the court?  Precisely one thing:  It re-
adopts the exact same �eligible entity� definition that the Third Circuit rejected in 2011!
This proceeding is proof of this agency�s plenary and purposeful abdication of its statutory duty.  
It shows that this Commission that does not believe it is accountable to Congress or the courts.  And it is 
evidence that unless Congress or a court steps in and takes action, this is the way that it will continue to 
be:  The Commission�s media ownership regulations will never be relaxed.  Efforts to promote diversity 
will remain stalled.  The law, the marketplace, and common sense will continue to be ignored.
Today�s result is all the more unfortunate because compromise was well within reach.  For 
example, a bipartisan majority of commissioners was willing to repeal the outdated Newspaper-Broadcast 
Cross-Ownership Rule.  But for some reason, we were told that this rule would not be repealed unless all 
commissioners agreed.  And sadly, one chose to exercise that veto.
As someone who has been on the losing end of more 3-2 votes than I care to remember, I am 
baffled by this new requirement for unanimity.  We�ve been told for years by the FCC�s leadership that 3-
2 votes are what democracy is all about.  Except, I guess, when it isn�t.  Or more precisely, 3-2 votes are 
what democracy is all about so long as the commissioners are divided cleanly along party lines.  As a 
result, we end up keeping a rule on the books that almost no one at the FCC actually believes make sense 
any longer.  This is a shame because our regulations should always be shaped only by the facts and law�
not crass political considerations.
If I were to detail all of this Order�s deficiencies, my dissenting statement would be almost as 
long as the Order itself (161 pages).  In the interest of space, I�ll focus on what I consider to be the 
Order�s most problematic aspects: (1) doubling down on the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership 
Rule; (2) tightening, rather than loosening, the Local Television Ownership Rule; and (3) failing to take 
meaningful action to promote diversity.

The newspaper industry is in crisis.  Since the FCC adopted the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-
Ownership Rule in 1975, approximately one-quarter of newspapers in the United States have gone out of

business.6 That�s over 400 publications.7 In the last decade, newspapers have shut down in Denver, 
Tucson, Cincinnati, Honolulu, Tampa, and other major cities.8 Other newspapers, including the New 
Orleans Times-Picayune and the Birmingham News, no longer publish on a daily basis.9 Still others, such 
as the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, have abandoned the print medium altogether and now exist only as a 
digital platform.10
Since 1975, the population of the United States has increased 49% while total newspaper 
circulation is down by one-third, with the substantial majority of that decline occurring since 2000.11  
Adjusting for inflation, newspaper advertising revenues, both print and digital, are down 64% since 2000, 
from $65.8 billion to $23.6 billion.12 And since 2000, employment in newspaper newsrooms has dropped 
by 42%.13
Earlier this month, Warren Buffett, whose company owns 32 newspapers across the country, 
summarized the bleak picture:  �[L]ocal newspapers continue to decline at a very significant rate.  And 
even with the economy improving, circulation goes down, advertising goes down, and it goes down in 
prosperous cities, it goes down in areas that are having urban troubles, it goes down in small towns�
that�s what amazes me.�14
Of course, newspaper reporters continue to do important work throughout our country each and 
every day.  Many were recently reminded of the impact that their stories can have through the 2015 film 
Spotlight, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture.  The movie focused on The Boston Globe�s 
investigation into widespread child sex abuse by Roman Catholic priests in and around Boston�reporting 
that ended up having a worldwide impact on the Catholic Church.  But given the newspaper industry�s 
profound financial troubles, it is becoming harder and harder for publications to do this type of 
investigatory journalism, hold our elected officials to account, and let Americans know what is going on 
in their communities.
That�s why it makes no sense for the government to be discouraging investment in the newspaper 
industry.  In this day and age, if you are willing to invest in a newspaper, we should be thanking you, not 
imposing regressive regulations.  But that is precisely what the Commission is doing in this Order by 
maintaining the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule.
Our action (or, to be more accurate, lack of action) is particularly unfortunate because 
broadcasters are well-situated to partner with newspapers.  The reason is simple.  Investments in 
newsgathering are more likely to be profitable when a company can distribute information over multiple

platforms.  This is not just a theory.  Because the FCC grandfathered newspaper-broadcast combinations 
that predated the 1975 adoption of the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule, we have seen this 
theory play out in practice across the United States.
The National Association of Broadcasters has pointed to no fewer than 15 studies demonstrating 
that newspaper-television cross-ownership increases the quantity and/or quality of news broadcast by 
cross-owned television stations.15 These studies span almost four decades, and some were commissioned 
by the FCC itself.  For example, one FCC-sponsored study in 2007 found that newspaper cross-owned 
TV stations supply about 7�10% more local news coverage and about 25% more coverage of state and 
local politics, on average, than non-cross-owned stations.16 And another FCC-sponsored study that same 
year found that cross-owned TV stations broadcast 11% more news programming than non-cross-owned 
stations.17 The same is true with respect to newspaper-radio cross-ownership.  An FCC-sponsored study 
found that a cross-owned radio station is four to five times more likely to have a news format than a non-
cross-owned station.18
And we need not rely on statistics alone.  The record contains numerous unrebutted examples of 
how newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership has provided more comprehensive news coverage to 
communities throughout our nation, including Atlanta, Cedar Rapids, Milwaukee, Phoenix, South Bend, 
Spokane, Topeka, and Amarillo.19 In Dayton, for example:
Cox Media Group�s cross-ownership of the Dayton Daily News and CBS affiliate WHIO-TV 
helped to uncover one of the most prominent stories of [2014]: the mismanagement of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs.  Working together, journalists at the newspaper and television 
station analyzed the quality of care that veterans were receiving, and discovered that the 
Department had paid more than $36 million to settle claims resulting from treatment delays.  
Months of congressional inquiries, national and global media studies, and, ultimately, the 
resignation of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs followed.  These treatment delays would not have 
come to light had it not been for the dogged efforts of both the newspaper and television 
reporters, working together.20
So in the face of all of this data and evidence, why does the Commission choose to retain the 
Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule?  It claims that this regulation remains necessary to promote 
viewpoint diversity.21 But the evidence overwhelmingly shows that there is little if any connection 
between viewpoint diversity and ownership.22 Most notably, a 2011 FCC-sponsored study found no 
statistically significant relationship between ownership and viewpoint diversity, and a 2012 update to that 
study actually found viewpoint diversity to be positively associated with the number of co-owned

television stations in a market.23 Indeed, research generally shows that a media outlet�s viewpoint is 
driven by the preferences of its audience rather than ownership.24
But the larger problem with the Commission�s conclusion is that it ignores the realities of the 
modern media marketplace.  This isn�t the 1970s anymore.  Most Americans don�t wait for the morning 
newspaper or the 11:00 PM newscast to learn what�s going on around the globe or at home.  That world 
set sail with The Love Boat.  Today, most Americans get the information they want when they want it by 
going online and scouring a wide variety of sources, including digital-only news outlets and social 
networks such as Facebook and Twitter.  When it comes to news, we can now choose from an amazingly 
diverse array of options.  Last year, for example, Pew Research Study counted 143 news providers in 
Denver alone.25
The record contains a plethora of statistics detailing how the Internet has transformed the 
American people�s consumption of news and information, and I don�t believe that it is necessary to 
review all of them here.  Instead, I�ll focus on two other glaring problems with the Commission�s analysis 
that render its decision to retain the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership rule in the name of viewpoint 
diversity fatally flawed.
First, the Commission contends that newspapers and broadcast television stations �continue to be 
the predominant providers of local news and information upon which consumers rely.�26 But then, in 
order to justify retaining the prohibition against common ownership of a newspaper and a radio station, 
the Commission also claims that �broadcast radio stations continue to be an important source of 
viewpoint diversity in local markets.�27  
These statements place the Commission on the horns of a dilemma.  The only reason that the 
Commission performs a stunning about-face and suddenly claims that radio stations are a significant 
source of viewpoint diversity28 is so that it can retain the Newspaper-Radio-Cross Ownership Rule (which 
generally prohibits cross-ownership).  But if radio stations are an important source of viewpoint diversity, 
then they must be included in the total number of voices in the market.  And if that is true, then there is no 
way that the agency�s Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule can survive.29
Take the New York City media market, for example.  If there are five major newspapers, over 
twenty television stations, and about 60 radio stations in the market contributing to viewpoint diversity, 
then how can prohibiting a newspaper from purchasing a single one of those radio stations or television 
stations be necessary to preserve viewpoint diversity?  With over 80 voices in the market, how can 
common ownership of just two cause a problem?

Second, the Commission discounts the rise of the Internet by arguing that most of the news found 
there is provided by websites affiliated with traditional providers, such as newspapers.30 (This myopic 
conclusion itself would be news to a wide variety of popular online upstarts, ranging from locally-focused 
platforms such as The Texas Tribune, which earned two Online News Association awards last year for 
explanatory and topical reporting, and Voice of San Diego, which has won national awards for its 
investigative reporting, to more nationally-focused platforms like BuzzFeed, Vox Media, and Yahoo! 
News.)  But the FCC�s regulation only precludes the common ownership of a broadcast station and a 
newspaper if the newspaper publishes at least four times a week.  So, for example, newspapers such as the 
Patriot-News of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or the Press-Register of Mobile, Alabama, which print only 
three days a week but update their websites constantly, may be commonly owned with a television 
station.
How does this make any sense?  If the content that a newspaper provides on its website is critical 
to the retention of the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule, why should it matter how many days 
a week it circulates a print edition?  So long as newspapers regularly update their websites with breaking 
news and information, why should a newspaper that offers a print edition seven days a week be treated 
differently than one that only distributes three print editions a week?  Or a newspaper that has chosen to 
go entirely online?  Why should we create an incentive for newspapers to cut back on print editions in 
order to get more favorable regulatory treatment?  The Order offers no answers to these questions.  That 
there are no good ones highlights how outdated the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule has 
become.  At a time when more and more content is being consumed over the Internet, it makes no sense 
to base ownership regulations on whether a news outlet distributes a print edition and/or how many times 
a week it does so.  The product, not pulp, is what matters.
Perhaps recognizing its difficulty in justifying the retention of the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-
Ownership, the Commission purports to �provide for a modest loosening� of it.31 However, the modest 
steps that it sets forth are entirely inadequate and largely illusory.
To begin with, the Commission adopts an express exception �for proposed combinations 
involving a failed or failing newspaper, television station, or radio station.�32 But the newspaper industry 
has explained that this standard�s specific criteria �will not open any opportunities for newspaper 
companies to obtain investment from the media industry, and certainly will not serve the public 
interest.�33 And there is an even more fundamental problem with this exception.  By the time that a 
newspaper has failed or is failing, it might be too late to save and/or might not be an attractive investment 
opportunity for a broadcaster.  Our goal should be to maintain newspapers as healthy and vibrant 
institutions.  We shouldn�t deprive them of the investment they need to thrive until they are at death�s 
doorstep and then hope that someone will swoop in at the last minute to save them. 
Additionally, the Commission states that companies may obtain a waiver of the Newspaper-
Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule if they are able �to show that their proposed combination would not 
unduly harm viewpoint diversity in the local market.�34 What does this mean?  Who knows?  Curiously, 
the Commission rejects re-adopting the four-factor test that applied to waiver requests under the vacated 
2007 modification of the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule because it claims that those factors 
(e.g., whether the combined entity would significantly increase the amount of local news in the market)

�would be vague, subjective, difficult to verify, and costly to enforce.�35 But the waiver standard adopted 
by the Commission today is far vaguer and more subjective than the 2007 standard for it lacks any
objective criteria.  �Knowing it when we see it� is hardly the stuff of administrative precision.
Moreover, we�ve seen this song-and-dance before.  When the Commission adopted JSA 
restrictions two years ago, it set up a similar waiver process to preserve beneficial JSAs that it publicly 
touted when useful for defending its new policy.36 But that process was a sham.  For the entire time that 
the Commission�s JSA restrictions were in effect, not one waiver request was granted.  (That may have 
been one reason why Congress, in an overwhelming bipartisan vote, required that the FCC protect 
existing JSAs.37)  I have little doubt that the same thing will happen here.
Where does that leave us?  In the face of overwhelming evidence of the newspaper industry�s dire 
condition, the benefits that newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership could bring, and a media marketplace 
transformed by the Internet, the Commission chooses to leave in place an absurdly antiquated rule that 
reduces investment in the newspaper business.  The FCC�s decision is not based on the law or the facts in 
the record.  Nor is it based on common sense.  For example, does anyone seriously believe that allowing a 
newspaper to buy a single radio station in any American city would harm anyone?  But politics�in 
particular, fear of partisan special interests in the Beltway that have banged the same sad drum for years 
(ironically, mainly online)�has made it impossible for us to repeal this rule.
At this rate, absent congressional or judicial intervention, the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-
Ownership Rule will outlive print newspapers themselves.
II.
In this Order, the Commission refuses to relax its Local Television Ownership Rule.  This rule 
prohibits anyone from owning two television stations in a Designated Market Area (DMA) unless at least 
one of those stations falls outside the top-four stations in the market (top-four prohibition) and there are at 
least eight independently-owned television stations in the DMA (eight-voices test).
However, record evidence demonstrates that the eight-voices test lacks any foundation in 
economics or the realities of today�s television marketplace.  Indeed, repealing that test would promote 
competition and localism in the video marketplace.
For one, the eight-voices test has no basis in modern competition theory and is inconsistent with 
fundamental antitrust principles.38 The test often prohibits mergers that �are unlikely to have adverse 
competitive effects and ordinarily require no further analysis,� according to the United States Department 
of Justice & Federal Trade Commission�s Horizontal Merger Guidelines.39 And it often prohibits 
transactions that do not create a presumption of increased market power according to those guidelines.40  
Simply put, in no other industry does the government condition mergers and acquisitions on the

maintenance of eight independent competitors in a market.  Indeed, under modern antitrust principles, the 
government does not impose any rigid screen at all.41
For this reason, economists Kevin Caves and Hal Singer have concluded that the eight-voices test 
�does not constitute a reliable competitive screening device.  Instead, [it] imposes a presumption of 
anticompetitive effects over transactions that would not justify such a presumption under standard 
antitrust practice.  [It] compounds this error by making its presumption impossible to overturn, regardless 
of evidence of procompetitive merger-driven efficiencies.�42
Caves and Singer�s analysis of advertising prices in all local television markets bears out their 
conclusion.43 Controlling for other factors, they found no statistically meaningful difference between 
advertising rates in markets with eight or more independently owned and operated television stations and 
advertising rates in markets with fewer voices.44  Moreover, their econometric analysis demonstrated that 
reducing the number of voices in a market has the impact of lowering advertising rates rather than raising
them, and that this effect holds true whether or not there are fewer than eight voices in a market.45  
Specifically, in markets with fewer than eight voices, local advertising rates are expected to fall by 2.9% 
with each decrease in the voice count.  And in markets with eight or more voices, such rates are expected 
to fall by 2.4% with each decrease in the voice count.46
These findings are fatal to the eight-voices test.  First, they demonstrate that there is no 
meaningful competitive difference between markets with fewer than eight voices and those with eight or 
more.  In each type of market, the response to the reduction in the voice count is similar; advertising rates 
are statistically the same controlling for other factors.  There is no significance to maintaining eight 
independently owned and operated stations in a market.  Thus, that number is entirely arbitrary.
Second, the Caves and Singer findings demonstrate that reducing the voice count by one in a 
market with fewer than eight voices leads to a more competitive market, not a less competitive one.  As 
reviewed above, when the voice count is reduced by one in such markets, advertising prices fall, not rise, 
in a statistically significant way.47

47 Unable to formulate a substantive response to the Caves & Singer Study, the Commission refuses to consider it, 
claiming that it was submitted too late.  See Order at note 147.  But this study merely provides additional empirical 
support for arguments that the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) has advanced throughout the 2010 and 
2014 Quadrennial Reviews.  See, e.g., NAB FNRPM Comments at 39, 55 (arguing that the eight-voices test is 
�arbitrary� and �makes no sense�).  As such, the Commission may not simply disregard it, and the authority that the 
Order relies upon for doing so is inapposite.  In Verizon v. FCC, 770 F.3d 961, 968 (D.C. Cir. 2014), for example, 
the D.C. Circuit said that the Commission was not obliged to consider a late-filed proposal for partial forbearance.  
Here, however, the Caves & Singer Study and NAB�s accompanying ex parte letter advanced no new proposal.  
Rather, they provided support for the NAB�s longstanding proposal in this proceeding for the FCC to eliminate the 
eight-voices test.  Similarly, in Globalstar, Inc. v. FCC, 564 F.3d 476, 484 (D.C. Cir. 2009), the D.C. Circuit ruled 
that a party had not provided the Commission with a fair opportunity to pass upon an argument by raising it the day 
an order had been adopted.  That case, however, deal with an entirely new claim of inadequate notice.  Here, by 
contrast, NAB merely submitted additional support for a claim that it has advanced for years during this proceeding.  
Moreover, the Caves & Singer Study was submitted weeks before this Order was adopted, not the day of adoption.  
While the Commission notes that UCC cites rule 1.415(d) (�No additional comments may be filed unless 
specifically requested or authorized by the Commission�) in opposing consideration of the Caves & Singer Study,

Another indication that the eight-voices test impedes competition and localism in the video 
marketplace is the mass of record evidence showing that common ownership of television stations in local 
television markets leads to more local news and information programming.48 According to the 
Commission, �[t]he data demonstrate that the duopolies permitted subject to the restrictions of the current 
rule have created tangible public interest benefits for viewers in local television markets that offset any 
potential harms associated with common ownership.  Such benefits include substantial operating 
efficiencies, which potentially allow a local broadcast station to invest more resources in news or other 
public interest programming that meets the needs of its local community.�49 In other words, common 
ownership increases competition and localism by creating stronger, better-funded competitors.
But the eight-voices test denies those benefits produced by common ownership to viewers in most 
of our nation�s television markets.  And those markets are the ones where the efficiencies of common 
ownership can yield the greatest benefits: smaller markets where advertising dollars (typically the source 
of funding for local programming) are scarce.
In contrast, the Order�s justification for maintaining the eight-voices test is utterly devoid of 
factual support.  Indeed, all the Commission can muster in support of the eight-voices test is two 
paragraphs of unsupported assertions.  In the first, the Order says:
Nearly every market with eight or more full-power television stations�absent a waiver of the 
Local Television Ownership Rule or unique circumstances�continues to be served by each of 
the Big Four networks and at least four independent competitors unaffiliated with a Big Four 
network.  Competition among these independently owned stations serves an important function 
by motivating both the major network stations and the independent stations to improve their 
programming, including increased local news and public interest programming.   This 
competition is especially valuable during the parts of the day in which local broadcast stations do 
not transmit the programming of affiliated broadcast networks and rely on local content uniquely 
relevant to the stations� communities.50
Let�s unpack this.  The Commission begins by arguing that competition between stations 
affiliated with the Big Four networks and at least four independent competitors unaffiliated with a Big 
Four network �serves an important function by motivating both the major network stations and the 
independent stations to improve their programming, including increased local news and public interest 
programming.�51 But what evidence does the Commission cite to support this proposition?  What 
evidence does it marshal to show that the presence of stations unaffiliated with a Big Four network 
improves the quality of programming in a television market?  What evidence does it produce to show that 
(Continued from previous page)    
see Order at note 147 (citing 47 C.F.R. � 1.1415(d)), the note to that rule specifically provides that in some 
rulemaking proceedings, �interested persons may also communicate with the Commission and its staff on an ex 
parte basis, provided that certain procedures are followed.�  In this proceeding, ex parte communications were 
specifically allowed by the Commission.  See 2014 Quadrennial Review Notice, 29 FCC Rcd at 4546, para. 378.  
Indeed, this Order is replete with references to ex parte communications.  See, e.g., Order at note 204.  Moreover, 
NAB indisputably complied with all relevant procedures in submitting the Caves & Singer Study.  Finally, it is 
important to recognize that the Commission frequently accepts and relies upon data and studies that it receives 
shortly before an order is adopted.  See, e.g., Amendment of Part 15 of the Commission�s Rules for Unlicensed 
Operations in the Television Bands, Repurposed 600 MHz Band, 600 MHz Guard Bands and Duplex Gap, and 
Channel 37 et al., ET Docket No. 14-165, Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd 9551, 9636, 9639, nn.523, 539 (2015)

Commission as an ex parte filing seventeen days before the Order�s adoption).

such independent stations lead to increased local news and public interest programming?  The answer to 
each of these questions is the same:  None.52
And even if the Commission were able to offer some evidence to back up its assertions, the 
question would then become:  Why is it important to have at least four independent competitors 
unaffiliated with a Big Four network in a market?  Why wouldn�t two or three suffice?  Or, on the other 
hand, why not five or six?  The Order makes a feeble attempt to address those questions in its next 
paragraph:
We continue to believe the minimum threshold maintained by the eight-voices test helps to ensure 
robust competition among local television stations in the markets where common ownership is 
permitted under the rule.  The eight-voices test increases the likelihood that markets with 
common ownership will continue to be served by stations affiliated with each of the Big Four 
networks as well as at least four independently owned and operated stations unaffiliated with 
these major networks.  Also, because a significant gap in audience share persists between the top-
four stations in a market and the remaining stations in most markets�demonstrating the 
dominant position of the top-four-rated stations in the market�we continue to believe that it is 
appropriate to retain the eight-voices test, which helps to promote at least four independent 
competitors for the top-four stations before common ownership is allowed.  Accordingly, we 
retain the eight-voices test.53
This explanation brings to mind the classic Peggy Lee song:  Is That All There Is?
To be sure, I agree that the eight-voices test �increases the likelihood that markets with common 
ownership will continue be served by stations affiliated with each of the Big Four networks as well as at 
least four independently owned and operated stations unaffiliated with these major networks.�54 But 
again, the key question is:  Why is it important to have �four independently owned and operated stations 
unaffiliated with these major networks?�  The only justification the Commission provides is the assertion 
that �a significant gap in audience share persists between the top-four stations in a market and the 
remaining stations in most markets.�55 But even assuming that to be true, how does this justify the choice 
of maintaining �four independently owned and operated stations unaffiliated with the major networks,� as 
opposed to two, three, five, or six?  The Order offers no explanation, cites no evidence, and refers to no 
economic theory.  It appears that the number four, and thus the eight in the �eight-voices test,� was 
plucked out of thin air.  Moreover, if there is a significant gap in audience share between the top-four 
stations and the other stations in a market, wouldn�t that suggest common ownership of non-top four 
stations would be pro-competitive, insofar as it would allow for stronger competitors to the top-four 
stations to emerge?
But it gets even worse.  The Commission readopts the restrictions on joint sales agreements 
(JSAs) that were vacated by the Third Circuit in Prometheus III�restrictions which have the practical 
effect of tightening the Local Television Ownership Rule.  The Commission provides little new analysis 
to justify these limits.  Rather, it �incorporate[s] by reference the rationale articulated� in its 2014 
Order.56 As such, rather than repeat at length the arguments that I advanced against the Commission�s 
  
52 Neither does the Order offer any explanation for why stations unaffiliated with a Big Four network play a distinct 
competitive role in the marketplace than those affiliated with a Big Four network.  Many of these stations, after all, 
are not independent stations.  Rather, they are affiliated with a national network, such as the CW or Univision.

JSA decision two years ago, I similarly incorporate by reference the relevant portions of my 2014 
dissenting statement.57 However, it is worth emphasizing three points.
First, just as the Commission is unable to point to any evidence to justify retaining the eight-
voices test, neither is it able to cite any evidence supporting its decision to readopt JSA restrictions.  Back 
in 2014, the Commission based its decision on its hypothesis that a JSA allows one station to exert undue 
influence over another station�s programming decision and operations.  But as I pointed out at the time, 
the Commission couldn�t come up with �a single example of a station in a JSA exercising undue 
influence over another station.�58 Indeed, it couldn�t round up �a single instance where a JSA has allowed 
one station to influence a single programming decision of another station.�59
Flash forward two years.  Despite the fact that numerous television stations across the country 
have participated in JSAs for many years, the Commission still cannot find a single case in which one 
station in a JSA has exercised undue influence over another station or influenced a single programming 
decision of another station.  The Commission�s JSA analysis remains unjustified jabberwocky.
Second, in my 2014 dissenting statement, I reviewed at length all of the public interest benefits 
that have been produced by JSAs.60 In this Order, the Commission does not contest any of those benefits.  
Instead, it claims that �[t]he arguments that television JSAs should not be attributed because they produce 
public interest benefits are essentially indistinguishable from arguments that the ownership limits should 
be relaxed because common ownership produces public interest benefits.  We acknowledge and address 
these arguments throughout; however, we ultimately determine that the Local Television Ownership Rule 
should be retained with a minor modification to the contour standard.�61
But here�s the problem with that evasion.  Maintaining the status quo with respect to JSAs is not
the equivalent of relaxing the Local Television Ownership Rule.  Rather, as the Third Circuit recognized, 
�[a]ttribution of television JSAs modifies the Commission�s ownership rules by making them more 
stringent.�62 And the Commission�s JSA decision here does not contain any rationale whatsoever for why 
the local television ownership rule should be tightened.  In fact, it concludes that the benefits of making 
the rule more stringent are outweighed by the harms of taking that step.63
So on one side of the ledger, we have uncontested evidence of the public interest benefits yielded 
by JSAs.  And on the other side of the ledger, the Commission points to no evidence of any corresponding 
harms and does not advance any argument for why the Local Television Ownership Rule should be made 
any stricter.  Yet, it does just that.  This deliberate refusal to make a �rational connection between the 
facts found and the choice made� defines arbitrary and capricious decision-making.64

Third, the decision to attribute television JSAs is fundamentally inconsistent with the 
Commission�s other recent attribution decisions.65 Consider, for example, last year�s repeal of the 
attributable material relationship (AMR) rule in the context of wireless spectrum.  The AMR rule used to 
require that the revenues of any company leasing or reselling more than 25% of the spectrum capacity of 
a small business�s wireless license must be attributed to that small business.  In 2015, however, the same 
Commission majority as here concluded that the AMR rule was �overbroad� and �we no longer need[ed] 
a bright-line, across-the-board, attribution rule to ensure that a small business makes independent 
decisions about its business operations.�66 This followed a 2014 decision where the same Commission 
majority as here waived the AMR rule for a private equity firm that leased 100% of its spectrum capacity 
to our nation�s two largest wireless carriers.  There, the Commission reasoned that the firm in question 
would not necessarily be �unduly influence[d]� by the wireless carriers leasing all of their spectrum 
capacity because of the firm�s representation that the �agreements at issue did not confer any� such 
influence.67
So here is where we are today.  Under the Commission�s rules, a small business can lease 100% 
of its spectrum capacity to a Fortune 50 wireless carrier�that is, engage in pure, profitable arbitrage�
without any attribution requirement being triggered.  Yet, as a result of today�s Order, attribution will 
automatically kick in whenever one television station sells more than 15% of another television station�s 
advertising time.
How does this make any sense?  The Commission purports to attribute television JSAs because 
selling 16% of a station�s advertising inventory gives licensees �the opportunity, ability, and incentive to 
exert significant influence over the brokered station.�68 Yet, one company leasing all of another 
company�s spectrum does not give rise to the same concerns regarding undue influence?  A company 
depending upon a 100% spectrum lease is plainly more subject to undue influence than a television 
station that agrees to let another station sell 16% of its advertising.  However, the Order offers no reason 
why the latter relationship, but not the former, triggers an attribution requirement.  As I�ve written before 
in commenting upon the 2014 waiver of the AMR rule, �A foolish consistency may be the hobgoblin of 
little minds, but a deliberate inconsistency is the ogre of arbitrariness.�69
III.
The Commission spends almost 50 pages discussing the issue of ownership diversity in this 
Order.  That�s certainly a lot of talk.  But what concrete action does this Commission take to advance 
diversity in the Order?  One thing:  It reinstates the very same �eligible entity� definition that the Third 
Circuit rejected five years ago.  To describe this decision is to discredit it.
During my time at the Commission, I have made it a priority to encourage greater diversity in the 
broadcast industry.  Each summer, for example, I meet with those participating in the Broadcast 
Leadership Training (BLT) Program, run by the National Association of Broadcasters Education 
Foundation.  The BLT program educates a diverse group of executives who aspire to be station owners or

managers by exposing them to �the fundamentals of purchasing, owning, and running a successful 
operation of radio and television stations.�70 Each time, I come away inspired by their spirit and 
optimistic about the future of broadcasting.  These sessions also reinforce my determination to do what I 
can at the FCC to expand opportunities in the industry.
Occasionally, I have been successful.  For example, the progress that the FCC has been able to 
make in revitalizing AM radio, the nation�s most diverse broadcast service, has been a big step forward.  
But too often, the Commission has fallen short.  The FCC�s leadership has prioritized setting aside 
spectrum for unlicensed operations in the post-auction television band over saving low-power television 
stations that often serve minority communities.  It has allowed the Advisory Committee for Diversity in 
the Digital Age to lay dormant.  And in this Order, it falls short once again.
I am particularly disappointed that the Commission refuses once again to adopt an incubator 
program, which would allow established broadcasters to provide financing and other forms of assistance 
to new entrants looking to break into the broadcasting business.  This proposal enjoys the support of civil 
rights organizations, including the National Urban League, LULAC, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the 
National Council of La Raza, the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council, and the Asian 
American Justice Center.71 It enjoys the support of industry.72 One would think that moving forward 
with this initiative would be a no-brainer.
The Commission claims that an incubator program would be too difficult to administer and 
consume too many staff resources.73 But it is difficult to take that argument seriously.  When the FCC�s 
leadership thinks that an issue is important, it is more than willing to adopt regulations that are difficult to 
administer and consume an enormous amount of staff resources, far more than any incubation program 
would.  Moreover, as detailed in the Order itself,74 the Commission has expended a lot of staff resources 
studying the broadcast diversity issue.  If we think that diversity is important, why not spend less time
researching the issue and more time actually doing something to make things better?
In my view, the real reason why the Commission refuses to adopt an incubator program is 
ideological in nature.  In order to incentivize broadcasters to incubate a new entrant, the FCC would allow 
participating broadcasters to own one more radio station in a market than they otherwise could under the 
local ownership rule.  A small number oppose this because they fear that this slight and targeted 
relaxation of our ownership rules would promote concentration in the radio industry.  But my response to 
them is simple.  The benefits of incubating a new voice in a market would far outweigh any such harm, 
especially since an incubator is likely to be most valuable in small-town markets where finding broadcast 
spectrum is easy but the economics of the broadcast business are hard.
* * *
As we bring our 2010 Quadrennial Review to an end, it is worth stepping back and looking at the 
FCC�s actions over the past few years from a broader perspective.  In the many years in which the 2010 
Quadrennial Review has been pending, the Commission has approved the $13.8 billion purchase by our 
nation�s largest cable operator (Comcast) of one of our nation�s top four broadcast networks (NBC).  It 
has signed off on the $49 billion merger of our nation�s second and fifth largest multichannel video 
programming distributors (AT&T and DIRECTV).  And it has blessed a single $79 billion transaction

combining our nation�s second, third, and sixth largest cable providers (Charter, Time Warner Cable, and 
Bright House).
Yet today, after many years of delay and �deliberation,� the FCC tells us the prospect of a 
newspaper purchasing a single television or radio station for relative pocket change still shocks the 
conscience?  One television station selling more than 15% of another�s advertising inventory in order to 
cut costs is a dire threat to competition?  A program to incubate diverse voices in the broadcast industry is 
a bridge too far because it would allow some companies to own an additional radio station in a market?  It 
makes no sense at all.
Soon, I expect outside parties to deliver us to the denouement: a decisive round of judicial review.  
I hope that the court that reviews this sad and total abdication of the administrative function finds, once 
and for all, that our media ownership rules can no longer stay stuck in the 1970s consistent with the 
Administrative Procedure Act, the Communications Act, and common sense.  The regulations discussed 
above are as timely as �rabbit ears,� and it�s about time they go the way of those relics of the broadcast 
world.  I am hopeful that the intervention of the judicial branch will bring us into the digital age.
For all of these reasons, I dissent.

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF 
COMMISSIONER MICHAEL O�RIELLY 
Re: 2014 Quadrennial Regulatory Review � Review of the Commission�s Broadcast Ownership Rules 
and Other Rules Adopted Pursuant to Section 202 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, MB 
Docket No. 14-50; 2010 Quadrennial Regulatory Review � Review of the Commission�s 
Broadcast Ownership Rules and Other Rules Adopted Pursuant to Section 202 of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, MB Docket No. 09-182; Promoting Diversification of 
Ownership in the Broadcasting Services, MB Docket No. 07-294; Rules and Policies Concerning 
Attribution of Joint Sales Agreements in Local Television Markets, MB Docket No. 04-256.
The Commission�s role with regard to the Quadrennial Review is quite straightforward.  While I 
strongly disagree with parameters set by past precedent � such as the idea that the pendulum can swing in 
both deregulatory and regulatory directions, or the misinterpretation of the word �necessary� contained in 
the law � we still are obligated to review the media landscape and determine whether each of our media 
ownership rules is �necessary in the public interest as the result of competition.�1 I still believe that the 
Commission can � and must � thoughtfully update our ownership rules while preserving competition, 
localism, and diversity.  For numerous reasons, however, the Commission has failed to comply with 
Congress� directive for almost a decade.  And yet, we were told by the Chairman almost two years ago 
that this time would be different.2 The end result, as represented in this item, is more of the same 
obfuscation, ignorance, hyper-partisanship and defiance as before.       
Prodded at long last by court order into completing the statutorily-mandated Quadrennial Review, 
the Commission has managed to produce a thoroughly objectionable document divorced from the realities 
of today�s media marketplace.  Social media giants, online news sites, over-the-top video content, 
traditional pay TV, and many other media sources are eating away at the audiences of broadcasters and 
newspapers by the day.  Congress anticipated this type of upheaval in the dynamic media environment, 
and designed the Quadrennial Review requirement to address it by forcing us to adjust our media 
ownership rules in response.  However, it seems that to my colleagues, all evidence of the myriad new 
challenges to the past dominance of newspapers and broadcasters serves merely as fodder for interesting 
gee-whiz anecdotes to be trotted out, never as a prompt for any responsive action by the Commission.  
Incredibly, the only significant changes this Commission is willing to make are those that serve to 
render current media ownership rules, last effectively amended in 1999, even more restrictive.  While 
grudgingly allowing for Congress� damage-minimizing directive to grandfather existing Joint Service 
Agreements (JSAs), the Order reinstalls the Commission�s 2014 JSA attribution rule, ignoring the 
evidence that JSAs have served the public interest well in many circumstances, and narrowing the options 
for broadcasters attempting to stretch scarce resources.3 And the Order doubles down on this punitive 
stance by requiring disclosure of Shared Service Agreements (SSAs) as a waystation en route to a 
promised proceeding regarding SSA attribution.4
Those are the only real modifications this Commission approves for media ownership rules that in 
some cases date back to the 1960�s.  No proposal to loosen or eliminate any rule, including proposals 
made by this same majority in the 2014 FNPRM to eliminate the restrictions on newspaper/radio and 
radio/television combinations, made the cut.  These cross-ownership bans create artificial silos that are

preventing broadcasters and newspapers from competing with new entrants and serving the needs of 
consumers.  With newspapers, in particular, facing well-documented struggles and in some instances, 
fighting for their very survival, eliminating the cross-ownership bans might provide some with much-
needed relief in the form of committed and knowledgeable investors.  But it seems my colleagues would 
rather throw the newspaper industry to the wolves than consider so much as a tweak to their article of 
faith that media ownership rules are forever.  And the new exception for failed or failing newspapers is an 
obvious procedural cover rather than a potential means of any relief, as it is highly unlikely that anyone 
will want to partner with a company that is in such distress.5 By then, it�s too late. 
The Commission also insists on maintaining the television duopoly rule, a restriction on 
ownership of two television stations in the same market, that may have made sense at its origin in 1964 
when consumers� video options were limited to a few broadcast networks via rabbit ears.  To say it is still 
needed in an era of literally hundreds of competitive pay TV channels and essentially unlimited 
competitive Internet content defies belief.  And keeping this rule ensures that several other equally 
anachronistic regulatory artifacts will make it to the year 2020 intact, such as the �Eight Voices Test.�  
This condition for duopoly ownership was previously struck down by the D.C. Circuit in 2002,6 and a 
previous Commission concluded that it could not be justified.7 Fourteen years later, it makes even less 
sense.  Why should the arbitrary number of eight stations be needed in order for a market to be considered 
competitive?  Why has this number never changed despite the changes in the media landscape?  More 
than half of U.S. markets do not have � and cannot support � eight independently owned stations,8 so 
potentially pro-competitive combinations that would benefit stations, and their viewers, cannot even be 
considered in most of the country.   
The Commission�s multiple errors stem from its indefensible failure to acknowledge any non-
broadcast or non-newspaper competitors as market participants in any context.  As the Order asserts, 
�[t]raditional media outlets � are still of vital importance to their local communities and essential to 
achieving the Commission�s goals of competition, localism, and viewpoint diversity.�9 But it is possible 
to agree to this sentiment while also realistically assessing and acknowledging the impact of new media 
on the marketplace.  In a recent Pew Research Center study focusing on the flow of local news in three 
U.S. markets, between 45 and 33 percent of residents stated that the internet is very important in keeping 
up with local news, while about 10 percent went so far as to say that social media are the most important 
way they get local news.10 And while it is true that some online news sources have a relationship with 
legacy print or TV players, 25 out of the 143 identified local news providers in one of the markets

distress for at least four months immediately prior to the filing of the assignment or transfer of control application, 
or that it was involved in court-supervised involuntary bankruptcy or involuntary insolvency proceedings.� A 
�failing� newspaper would need to show a negative cash flow for the previous three years, and in addition that �the 
in-market buyer is the only reasonably available candidate willing and able to acquire and operate the failed or 
failing newspaper � and that selling the newspaper � to any out-of-market buyer would result in an artificially 
depressed price.�

studied, Denver, were pure digital-only outlets.11 The digital media future is here.  And it is, of course, 
having a tangible impact on local markets:
 
Taken together, the data illustrate that when it comes to news ecologies, the greater 
digital orientation and array of providers in Denver widen the local news system 
somewhat with less reliance on the major legacy providers, especially the local 
newspaper, and a greater mix of coverage more often driven by enterprising work from 
journalists.12  
Further, to the extent that social media may have once predominantly used traditional media links in 
timeline updates, tweets and the like, that practice has changed significantly.  Online media platforms 
have become much more news first environments as crowdsourcing users often post faster and more 
accurately than traditional media sources.  In reality, consumers are more likely to learn about the latest 
Michael Phelps gold medal at the Rio Olympics on a Twitter feed than to wait for an update to a sports or 
news website or to see the local ten p.m. newscast.    
While the evolution of the legacy media world is clearly far from complete, the Commission�s 
duty is to respond to the obvious and far-reaching changes that Americans, and our legacy media, are 
living under today.  However, while �recogniz[ing] that broadband Internet and other technological 
advances have changed the ways in which many consumers access entertainment, news and information 
programming,�13 the Commission fails to reflect that recognition by changing a single one of its media 
ownership rules, thus missing the entire point of the Quadrennial Review exercise.  What good does it do 
for the Commission to �recognize� the full 2016 media landscape if it does absolutely nothing in 
response?  With many news stories being broken over social media or news websites already this year, it 
is hard to imagine what it would take for reality set in and convince this Commission to budge, absent a 
court mandate or change in law.
One reason provided for inaction on the media ownership rules involving television is that the 
Commission is in the midst of the broadcast spectrum incentive auction, creating uncertainty for the 
future of the media marketplace.14 This excuse rings extremely hollow when considering that despite 
Congress� full knowledge of section 202(h), it declined to include an exemption or delay of the 
Quadrennial Review when it crafted and enacted the incentive auction legislation.  As I have previously 
argued, this Commission can�t read an exemption in the law where one does not exist.  Does the on-going 
incentive auction make our job more complex?  Perhaps, but not impossible.  Thus, no weight should be 
given to this weak and misapplied argument.    
In a disturbing echo of process fouls past, the Chairman chose to continue his practice of only 
approving an item if the majority party commissioners are in unison.  Clearly, there were at least three 
votes, and perhaps four, for eliminating the cross-ownership rules, especially the newspaper/radio 
prohibition.  But that wasn�t good enough.  The fact that one Democratic member objected effectively 
meant that no changes were permitted.  This blatant political move should be seen for what it is.  In some 
regards, it is hard to be surprised at this approach in the current political atmosphere in Washington D.C., 
except that is not how an �independent� Commission should operate.  How can any claimed attempt at

consensus-building be taken seriously when the consensus supposedly sought can and will be so easily set 
aside?    
In retrospect, the biggest problem with the Quadrennial Review that Congress likely couldn�t 
anticipate was that those seeking to maintain the status quo could continuously �win� through 
Commission intransigence and court remands.  In fact, the more flawed the item is, the more likely the 
court can be used as an instrument of delay.  More specifically, court review of the Commission�s work in 
this area has served as just another tool of the public �interest� groups seeking to prevent any 
modernization of our rules.  By remanding the item back to the Commission to comply with some 
objective, the court merely extends the life of all the media ownership rules � a total victory for the forces 
of inertia.    
 
In short, rarely have I seen a proceeding take so long and a document say so much in order to 
accomplish nothing of value.  I dissent.
